      "description": "Aerophone AE-10 is a digital wind instrument that lets you play sax, clarinet, flute, violin, synth sounds and many more. Since it supports traditional sax fingering, the AE-10 is instantly familiar to acoustic sax players, especially with a mouthpiece-mounted breath sensor that responds like an acoustic horn. The AE-10 also features 128* high-quality sound models including soprano and baritone sax, clarinet, trumpet, string instruments, and an array of expressive synth sounds. And the integrated speaker and battery operation means that you can play these sounds anywhere. With built-in speakers, headphones for late-night practice, battery power capability, and DAW connectivity, the Roland Aerophone AE-10 is the versatile, play-anywhere choice that supports you in every musical scenario.\n\n*Version 3.0 software includes 128 tones, with 66 new tones to expand your repertoire\n\nNothing beats the sound of your favorite acoustic sax, but sometimes its tone might not be quite right for the job at hand. Whatever scenario you\u2019re playing in, the Aerophone AE-10 has the onboard digital sax sounds you need. Choose from alto, tenor, soprano, and baritone sax types, all of which respond just like their acoustic counterparts. Playing dynamics, articulation, and even the organic overtone changes caused by your breathing are all reproduced thanks to Roland\u2019s advanced SuperNATURAL modeling technology. A dedicated \u201cSax Section\u201d layers four types of sax for playing together in unison, and you can pull off a seamless performance with the Full Range feature, which automatically switches between sax types by key range.\n\nThe Aerophone AE-10 also features sounds from other wind instruments including trumpet, trombone, clarinet, flute, oboe, bassoon, and more. Powered by Roland\u2019s SuperNATURAL technology, which faithfully matches the behavior of the originals, these sounds help to expand your musical range. Ethnic instruments like shakuhachi and erhu are on hand too, offering authentic pitch and tonal fluctuations that echo their acoustic counterparts. Aerophone AE-10 even includes stringed instruments such as violin, cello, and contrabass, each one capable of unique musical expressions since you control them by breath and fingering instead of bowing. Once you\u2019ve tried the individual sounds, you can create one-man ensembles by layering multiple wind instrument sounds with the Brass Section setting. The AE-10 is also packed with a selection of the latest synth sounds that are specially tailored for wind instrument performance with fully optimized breath control.\n\nYou\u2019ve worked hard to nail your sax technique, but most digital horns make you master a new fingering system, which can be a major setback. With the Roland Aerophone AE-10, it\u2019s a smooth transition, thanks to a layout that\u2019s similar to your favorite acoustic sax\u2014right down to the left-hand octave key. Plus, the AE-10 has a sensitive mouthpiece-mounted breath sensor that also functions as a bite sensor, allowing expressive techniques like vibrato and pitch. Even beginners will be able to enjoy playing the various onboard sounds straight away.\n\nWherever and whenever you play, the portable and lightweight Roland Aerophone AE-10 is ready. Six AA batteries provide mobile power, and onboard monitor speakers deliver comfortable sound for intimate performing situations. You also have the ability to directly connect to a PA or amp for broader coverage, eliminating the need to use a mic. When you need to cover large instruments like tuba and bassoon, the battery-powered Roland CUBE Street EX is a great companion, giving you big sound in a portable package. Playing sessions are even more fun when you connect to your smartphone via the Aerophone AE-10\u2019s stereo mini jack and jam along with favorite songs. And thanks to the headphones option, you can play around the clock without disturbing family members and neighbors.\n\nPlaying sessions are even more fun when you connect a smartphone or music player to jam along with favorite songs. Your device connects to the stereo mini-jack input on the Aerophone AE-10, and plays through the onboard monitor speakers or connected headphones.\n\nWhile the Roland Aerophone AE-10 is a powerful standalone instrument, it also lets you get creative with external gear. You can connect to your computer via USB to play soft synths and external MIDI sound modules through your DAW, with breath control providing a world of unique expression not possible with keyboard synthesizers.\n\nThe Aerophone Editor is a free iOS app for the Aerophone AE-10 that lets you adjust tones, set various playing parameters, and organize tone lists. You\u2019re able to deeply customize sounds and functions with parameters only available in the app, and easily create tone lists for different performance and practice situations. Via a convenient interface, you have access to four tone layers, various controller assignments, effects settings, and more. The Aerophone Editor is a must-have tool to perfectly tailor your Aerophone AE-10 for your own personal playing style.\n\nLearn More...\n\nThe new Roland Aerophone AE-10 is a trailblazing digital wind instrument that fuses a traditional saxophone fingering system with a library of onboard acoustic and synth sounds, plus a breath sensor that reacts just like your favorite acoustic horn. US-based DJ and multi-instrumentalist Masego explores the expressive capabilities of the AE-10\u2019s alto sax sound.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing worse than a studio session grinding to a halt because you need an instrument that you haven\u2019t brought along. That won\u2019t happen with the Aerophone AE-10, as it features 40 acoustic and synth sounds, all powered by Roland\u2019s SuperNATURAL technology for natural and accurate response.  US-based DJ and multi-instrumentalist Masego explores some of the AE-10\u2019s onboard sounds while accompanied by an original backing track.\n\nRegardless of the sound you use, the Aerophone AE-10 provides an paralleled level of expression suitable for any genre of music.  UK-based saxophone player Alistair Parnell, accompanied by the Equinox Saxophone Ensemble, layers onboard synth lead sounds with external synth sounds in an extract from Nigel Wood's \u201cPartial Eclipse\u201d for solo wind synth and wind ensemble (www.saxtetpublications.com).\n\nWherever and whenever you play, the portable and lightweight Aerophone AE-10 is ready. Onboard monitor speakers deliver comfortable sound for intimate performing situations and six AA batteries provide convenient on-the-go power. The AE-10\u2019s mobility is spotlighted in this open-air performance by the Japan-based trio sax triplets.\n\nWhile the Roland Aerophone AE-10 is a powerful standalone instrument, it also lets you get creative with external gear. You can connect to a computer via USB to play soft synths and external MIDI sound modules through your DAW, with breath control providing a world of unique expression not possible with keyboard synthesizers. In this performance, Spanish sax player Llibert Fortuny mixes the AE-10's onboard sounds with soft synths and backing loops from Ableton Live.\n\nOP-AE10MP\n              Replacement Mouthpiece\n\nRH-300\n              Stereo Headphones\n\nThe performance features 11 musicians, including 9 acoustic saxophone players and 2 Aerophone players. Alistair Parnell performs with the Aerophone AE-10, while Dan Gribbin performs with Aerophone GO.\n\nThe new synth sounds of firmware update version 2.00 are brought to life in this composition written and performed by UK saxophonist and established wind synth player, Alistair Parnell.\n\nRandal Fisher, Steve Brickman, and Hailey Niswanger reflect on their wind instrument journeys, creative processes, and the breath itself.Read more\u2026\n\nThe Roland Aerophone is a convenient, low-maintenance way to spend more time on your music.

      "description": "Meet Aerophone Brisa, an exciting evolution of the growing Roland Aerophone platform. This elegant instrument combines the design and key layout of a traditional flute with the modern benefits of the Aerophone series, including a diverse selection of onboard sounds and deep customization options. Aerophone Brisa also features a newly developed sound engine tailored for different wind instrument styles, with a special focus on the unique articulations and techniques used by flute players.\n\nDiscover the Roland Aerophone Brisa, a revolutionary digital wind instrument designed with flute players in mind. In this in-depth video, flutist Elena Pinderhughes guides you through everything you need to know about Brisa, from expressive sound demos to intuitive design features that adapt to your unique playing style.\n\nIn this exclusive performance, visionary saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings brings Brisa to life, blending his spiritual jazz roots with futuristic textures and tones. His dynamic improvisation showcases the expressive depth and versatility of Brisa, proving that tradition and innovation can coexist in perfect harmony.\n\nWatch acclaimed flutist and composer Elena Pinderhughes bring the Aerophone Brisa to life in this expressive sound demo performance. From acoustic emulations to bold synth textures, Elena showcases Brisa\u2019s wide sonic palette with artistry and flair.\n\nCreating with Aerophone Brisa is a comfortable and friendly experience for flutists, players of other wind instruments, and beginners alike. The stylish, lightweight design offers a straight structure, responsive flute-style keys, and intuitive controls, making playing effortless and enjoyable.\n\nAerophone Brisa features SuperNATURAL Winds, a new Aerophone sound engine that leverages our latest advancements in natural wind expression. Delivering rich, inspiring tones, it faithfully translates every breath nuance into vibrant sound, mirroring the immediate response and dynamic control of acoustic instruments.\n\nWith 100 onboard tones, Aerophone Brisa is ready to fuel limitless creative journeys. Explore a library of flute family instruments, from concert flutes and piccolos to bass and jazz flutes. Expand your range with winds such as saxophone, clarinet, and trumpet, and go further with orchestral strings and world sounds like pan flute and shakuhachi. You can even perform contemporary music styles with modern synthesizers and drum sounds.\n\nEquipped with our newly developed dual breath sensor system, Aerophone Brisa provides natural wind control that will be familiar to all types of players. In contrast with a traditional flute, sound is produced by blowing directly into the mouthpiece, simplifying the playing experience. By adjusting the head joint, it\u2019s easy to dial in the most comfortable playing angle. You can also execute flute octave switching techniques by directing your breath between the two mouthpiece holes as you play.\n\nAerophone Brisa offers multiple fingering options to meet the needs of a wide range of players. Flute and trumpet modes are available, along with a Brisa mode that\u2019s ideal for saxophone and recorder players and anyone new to wind instruments. There are also special fingering modes for playing the instrument with only the right or left hand.\n\nAerophone Brisa\u2019s versatile digital engine allows you to add harmonies and drones to your playing, enriching solo and ensemble sessions with tonalities that typically require multiple musicians. There\u2019s also a transposition function that lets you play any musical piece with your most comfortable fingering.\n\nThere are numerous ways to control Aerophone Brisa sounds in real time, unlocking all-new performance approaches. Use the thumb and S1/S2 buttons to enhance tones with harmonies and unique expressive colors. And with the instrument\u2019s integrated motion sensor, you can apply vibrato, pitch bend, and other effects with simple body movements.\n\nAerophone Brisa flows everywhere your creative life takes you. With the onboard speaker, headphone jack, and rechargeable battery, you can play anytime and anywhere. The USB-C port provides audio/MIDI communication with music production apps, and the headphone output can also be used to connect with a sound system for live performances. In addition, Bluetooth MIDI is available to send wireless MIDI data to Bluetooth-enabled devices and expand your control options with the BOSS FS-1-WL and EV-1-WL.\n\nThis powerful companion app extends the Aerophone Brisa experience with your smartphone or tablet. Adjust internal parameters from your device\u2019s touchscreen, save and recall favorite sounds, and use the fingering display to study layouts and view notes as you play them. You also get integrated access to many additional sounds on Roland Cloud to expand your creative range.\n\nAerophone Brisa Plus\n\nIn this in-depth video, flutist Elena Pinderhughes guides you through everything you need to know about Brisa, from expressive sound demos to intuitive design features that adapt to your unique playing style.\n\nThe Aerophone Brisa Engineering team discusses the power and potential of the latest addition to the family of instruments.Read more\u2026\n\nLearn how the Aerophone series offers wind players a versatile and expressive way to explore new sounds and performance styles while staying true to familiar techniques.Read more\u2026\n\nCompanion app for Aerophone Brisa.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner\u2019s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "Take online gaming sound to the next level with BRIDGE CAST, your all-in-one solution for premium livestream audio. This customizable desktop hub is packed with secret weapons to take out the competition, including dual sound mixes, vocal transformer effects, music playback, sound effects, and support for a broadcast-grade mic and headphones. In the heat of the battle, BRIDGE CAST ensures that your audio is always as epic as your gameplay.\n\nThe companion BRIDGE CAST app takes your experience even further, allowing you to customize BRIDGE CAST audio features and enhance streams with royalty-free background music tracks and sound effects via BGM CAST and Roland Cloud.\n\nLearn how BRIDGE CAST's powerful audio tools will elevate your gaming streams with professional sound quality and easy real-time mixing control.\n\nBRIDGE CAST gives you what you need to deliver outstanding sound in every session, coupled with killer sonic tools to help you stand out from the crowd. Roland has been a leading innovator in electronic music and audio/video gear for over 50 years. With BRIDGE CAST on your desktop, you\u2019ll be driving your sound with the brand trusted by generations of top creators worldwide.\n\nConnect BRIDGE CAST to your gaming computer via USB-C.\n\nPlug in a professional microphone to the XLR input.\n\nHook up your headphones.\n\nCustomize the audio and panel functions with the companion app.\n\nSet up personal and stream mixes with the hands-on controls.\n\nBRIDGE CAST lets you chat and interact using a broadcast-grade dynamic or condenser microphone, the foundation of any professional audio setup. The high-performance XLR mic preamp delivers clear, dynamic sound in the box, with no need for messy external add-ons. You get superior audio monitoring too, with a powerful headphone amplifier and high-sensitivity output for pro-quality phones. The versatile headphones connector also supports a headset mic for a quick, single-cable connection.\n\nWith the dual audio mixer in BRIDGE CAST, you can independently balance the mic level, team chats, gameplay sounds, and background music for you and your viewers. Give yourself a winning advantage with a personal mix that prioritizes what you need to hear while gaming. Then create a separate stream mix that\u2019s perfectly balanced for maximum online engagement.\n\nAlong with a headphones output, BRIDGE CAST has a line output for external gaming speakers. Level knobs for each output let you easily control volumes and smoothly transition between phones and speakers during gameplay. There\u2019s also a dedicated streaming level control to dial in the sound for your online audience.\n\nMorph your voice and become your character with fun processing derived from Roland\u2019s famous VT voice transformer products. Adjust the pitch and formant to change your age or gender. Or go even further and take on the persona of a beast or alien.\n\nBRIDGE CAST also includes EQ, compression, and other pro vocal processing to level up your streams. A low-cut filter softens pesky \u201cP\u201d and \u201cT\u201d plosives, while the de-esser cleans up harsh \u201cS\u201d tones. There\u2019s a noise suppressor to throttle background distractions, plus reverb to launch your voice into another dimension. And with the muscular hardware DSP handling the audio load, all your computer power is dedicated to gaming and streaming.\n\nImmerse yourself in 5.1 or 7.1 virtual surround sound for headphones and stereo speaker systems, powered by advanced Roland technology. Audio is converted from a PC to virtual surround sound via a USB connection, delivering a powerful and engaging sound experience.\n\nSlay your competition by highlighting important game sounds with Game EQ presets. Pinpoint audio frequencies and boost their levels to make it easier to hear critical elements, like enemy footsteps in first-person shooter games. You can even fine-tune while visually monitoring the analyzed waveform in real time. Once you find the ideal settings for different game titles, save them in onboard profiles and call them up with quick button presses while playing.\n\nBuilding your brand is an essential part of creating an online following. Choose your core BRIDGE CAST look with bold Black and Ice White finish options. And take it to another level by customizing the detachable faceplate using our downloadable skin template, which allows you to personalize the panel with your team or gamertag design. It\u2019s also possible to customize the LED colors of the four control knobs for additional flair.\n\nThe ergonomic BRIDGE CAST panel lets you easily control your mix while staying focused on the game. Everything you need is at your fingers, including grab-and-go level knobs and assignable buttons for muting sounds and accessing various functions. The rock-solid design won\u2019t move around on your desktop, and the discrete rear-panel connections keep clutter in check.\n\nThe powerful BRIDGE CAST app works in tandem with the hardware, giving you full access to an array of in-depth features. Dial in mic and audio parameters, configure Game EQ presets, and more. You can also re-assign hardware controls for your needs and save/recall custom BRIDGE CAST configurations for different games and streaming audiences.\n\nUsing the BRIDGE CAST app, effortlessly tailor your sound with intuitive microphone settings for speed and precision. The version 5.00 update allows you to adjust EQ with quick-access controls and use the studio-grade compressor to achieve a clean, professional vocal sound with a single fader. There's also an expander that minimizes unwanted background noise without unnatural artifacts.\n\nWith BGM CAST, adding background music and sonic color to streams has never been easier. Available through the BRIDGE CAST app and Roland Cloud, BGM CAST puts a growing selection of royalty-free background music and sound effects at your fingertips. Choose music by mood and genre or create playlists of your favorites for stress-free music management. You can also assign sound effects to the four hardware buttons for instant triggering.\n\nA free Roland Account provides 36 background music tracks and 16 sound effects to use at no charge. Signing up for Roland Cloud Core membership through the BRIDGE CAST app unlocks thousands of additional music tracks and hundreds of sound effects, with new selections added each month. Membership also includes powerful tools for modern music creators, including the ZENOLOGY synthesizer, Zenbeats production software, Sound Packs, and more.\n\nGet the BRIDGE CAST App\n\nIf you need a unified audio and video solution, be sure to check out BRIDGE CAST X.

      "description": "Do you have a passion for music? GO:KEYS 3 makes it easy to go from being a fan to an active music creator. This fun modern keyboard unlocks a simple new approach to making music, encouraging you to explore sounds and ideas in the moment\u2014no previous experience required. Just power on, push a few buttons, and let your imagination flow. And as your skills develop, deeper features allow you to travel as far as your ambition takes you.\n\nWith GO:KEYS 3 under your fingers, you have everything you need to turn your musical dreams into reality.\n\nLearning music doesn\u2019t have to be hard. GO:KEYS 3 invites exploration at every turn, urging your inner creative voice to emerge. The friendly, interactive interface stimulates discovery and spontaneous musical moments, even if you\u2019ve never played an instrument before.\n\nAs many top composers will tell you, playing one note with an inspiring sound is often all it takes to spark a complete idea. GO:KEYS 3 includes over 1000 sounds from Roland\u2019s historic library, which has motivated top music artists in every genre for over 50 years. Journey through a universe of possibilities with the expressive 61-note keyboard, from acoustic pianos and orchestral instruments to modern synthesizers, guitars, drums, and beyond.\n\nOnce you find a sound that energizes you, experiment by creating melodies and arpeggios over automatic musical backing. GO:KEYS 3 is filled with ready-made chord progressions in various styles, all with the immersive sound of a finished record. It\u2019s also possible to craft your own chord sequences, and you can easily find the progressions for your favorite songs online or with dedicated apps.\n\nAs a chord progression loops, discover your own performance style by remixing sounds. Change things up with four variations. Drop parts in and out, including the drums, bass, and backing chords. Swap instruments for a different vibe. And create dynamic energy by processing the entire sound with filtering, lo-fi tones, beat slicing, and other ear-catching performance effects.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve mastered chord progressions, go even further by directing a band of virtual musicians. GO:KEYS 3 offers a wide selection of dynamic accompaniments controlled by one or two left-hand fingers. Jam melodies and solos with your right hand as the band backs every move. Then weave in more sophisticated textures with full left-hand chords as your technique grows.\n\nAt any time, you can instantly capture what you\u2019re doing with GO:KEYS 3 and listen back. Analyze and hone your ideas. Show off your progress with family and friends. Or share your skills with the world on social media.\n\nWith its portable, all-in-one design, you can pick up GO:KEYS 3 and enjoy music anywhere in your living space. The built-in stereo sound system delivers rich, satisfying sound, while support for AA battery power makes setup fast and easy. And when you want to play privately, plug in headphones or earbuds to enjoy GO:KEYS 3 without disturbing others.\n\nListening to your favorite music is a great way to inspire the next creative session. Play songs from your music library via Bluetooth or USB memory and jam along. Then, use the center cancel function to remove the vocals and sing them yourself. GO:KEYS 3 also supports Bluetooth MIDI and audio/MIDI over USB, opening the door to further creative possibilities with music apps on a computer or mobile device.\n\nWant more inspiration? On Roland Cloud, there\u2019s an ever-growing selection of premium sounds and exciting new arranger styles to explore. GO:KEYS 3 also supports Roland Cloud Connect, an optional wireless adapter that lets you browse, audition, and download Roland Cloud content from your smartphone.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to take the next step in your musical journey, Melodics Essentials for Roland is the perfect partner to extend the GO:KEYS experience.
