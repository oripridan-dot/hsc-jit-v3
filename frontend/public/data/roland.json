      "description": "Meet Aerophone Brisa, an exciting evolution of the growing Roland Aerophone platform. This elegant instrument combines the design and key layout of a traditional flute with the modern benefits of the Aerophone series, including a diverse selection of onboard sounds and deep customization options. Aerophone Brisa also features a newly developed sound engine tailored for different wind instrument styles, with a special focus on the unique articulations and techniques used by flute players.\n\nDiscover the Roland Aerophone Brisa, a revolutionary digital wind instrument designed with flute players in mind. In this in-depth video, flutist Elena Pinderhughes guides you through everything you need to know about Brisa, from expressive sound demos to intuitive design features that adapt to your unique playing style.\n\nIn this exclusive performance, visionary saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings brings Brisa to life, blending his spiritual jazz roots with futuristic textures and tones. His dynamic improvisation showcases the expressive depth and versatility of Brisa, proving that tradition and innovation can coexist in perfect harmony.\n\nWatch acclaimed flutist and composer Elena Pinderhughes bring the Aerophone Brisa to life in this expressive sound demo performance. From acoustic emulations to bold synth textures, Elena showcases Brisa’s wide sonic palette with artistry and flair.\n\nCreating with Aerophone Brisa is a comfortable and friendly experience for flutists, players of other wind instruments, and beginners alike. The stylish, lightweight design offers a straight structure, responsive flute-style keys, and intuitive controls, making playing effortless and enjoyable.\n\nAerophone Brisa features SuperNATURAL Winds, a new Aerophone sound engine that leverages our latest advancements in natural wind expression. Delivering rich, inspiring tones, it faithfully translates every breath nuance into vibrant sound, mirroring the immediate response and dynamic control of acoustic instruments.\n\nWith 100 onboard tones, Aerophone Brisa is ready to fuel limitless creative journeys. Explore a library of flute family instruments, from concert flutes and piccolos to bass and jazz flutes. Expand your range with winds such as saxophone, clarinet, and trumpet, and go further with orchestral strings and world sounds like pan flute and shakuhachi. You can even perform contemporary music styles with modern synthesizers and drum sounds.\n\nEquipped with our newly developed dual breath sensor system, Aerophone Brisa provides natural wind control that will be familiar to all types of players. In contrast with a traditional flute, sound is produced by blowing directly into the mouthpiece, simplifying the playing experience. By adjusting the head joint, it’s easy to dial in the most comfortable playing angle. You can also execute flute octave switching techniques by directing your breath between the two mouthpiece holes as you play.\n\nAerophone Brisa offers multiple fingering options to meet the needs of a wide range of players. Flute and trumpet modes are available, along with a Brisa mode that’s ideal for saxophone and recorder players and anyone new to wind instruments. There are also special fingering modes for playing the instrument with only the right or left hand.\n\nAerophone Brisa’s versatile digital engine allows you to add harmonies and drones to your playing, enriching solo and ensemble sessions with tonalities that typically require multiple musicians. There’s also a transposition function that lets you play any musical piece with your most comfortable fingering.\n\nThere are numerous ways to control Aerophone Brisa sounds in real time, unlocking all-new performance approaches. Use the thumb and S1/S2 buttons to enhance tones with harmonies and unique expressive colors. And with the instrument’s integrated motion sensor, you can apply vibrato, pitch bend, and other effects with simple body movements.\n\nAerophone Brisa flows everywhere your creative life takes you. With the onboard speaker, headphone jack, and rechargeable battery, you can play anytime and anywhere. The USB-C port provides audio/MIDI communication with music production apps, and the headphone output can also be used to connect with a sound system for live performances. In addition, Bluetooth MIDI is available to send wireless MIDI data to Bluetooth-enabled devices and expand your control options with the BOSS FS-1-WL and EV-1-WL.\n\nThis powerful companion app extends the Aerophone Brisa experience with your smartphone or tablet. Adjust internal parameters from your device’s touchscreen, save and recall favorite sounds, and use the fingering display to study layouts and view notes as you play them. You also get integrated access to many additional sounds on Roland Cloud to expand your creative range.\n\nAerophone Brisa Plus\n\nIn this in-depth video, flutist Elena Pinderhughes guides you through everything you need to know about Brisa, from expressive sound demos to intuitive design features that adapt to your unique playing style.\n\nThe Aerophone Brisa Engineering team discusses the power and potential of the latest addition to the family of instruments.Read more…\n\nLearn how the Aerophone series offers wind players a versatile and expressive way to explore new sounds and performance styles while staying true to familiar techniques.Read more…\n\nCompanion app for Aerophone Brisa.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "Take online gaming sound to the next level with BRIDGE CAST, your all-in-one solution for premium livestream audio. This customizable desktop hub is packed with secret weapons to take out the competition, including dual sound mixes, vocal transformer effects, music playback, sound effects, and support for a broadcast-grade mic and headphones. In the heat of the battle, BRIDGE CAST ensures that your audio is always as epic as your gameplay.\n\nThe companion BRIDGE CAST app takes your experience even further, allowing you to customize BRIDGE CAST audio features and enhance streams with royalty-free background music tracks and sound effects via BGM CAST and Roland Cloud.\n\nLearn how BRIDGE CAST's powerful audio tools will elevate your gaming streams with professional sound quality and easy real-time mixing control.\n\nBRIDGE CAST gives you what you need to deliver outstanding sound in every session, coupled with killer sonic tools to help you stand out from the crowd. Roland has been a leading innovator in electronic music and audio/video gear for over 50 years. With BRIDGE CAST on your desktop, you’ll be driving your sound with the brand trusted by generations of top creators worldwide.\n\nConnect BRIDGE CAST to your gaming computer via USB-C.\n\nPlug in a professional microphone to the XLR input.\n\nHook up your headphones.\n\nCustomize the audio and panel functions with the companion app.\n\nSet up personal and stream mixes with the hands-on controls.\n\nBRIDGE CAST lets you chat and interact using a broadcast-grade dynamic or condenser microphone, the foundation of any professional audio setup. The high-performance XLR mic preamp delivers clear, dynamic sound in the box, with no need for messy external add-ons. You get superior audio monitoring too, with a powerful headphone amplifier and high-sensitivity output for pro-quality phones. The versatile headphones connector also supports a headset mic for a quick, single-cable connection.\n\nWith the dual audio mixer in BRIDGE CAST, you can independently balance the mic level, team chats, gameplay sounds, and background music for you and your viewers. Give yourself a winning advantage with a personal mix that prioritizes what you need to hear while gaming. Then create a separate stream mix that’s perfectly balanced for maximum online engagement.\n\nAlong with a headphones output, BRIDGE CAST has a line output for external gaming speakers. Level knobs for each output let you easily control volumes and smoothly transition between phones and speakers during gameplay. There’s also a dedicated streaming level control to dial in the sound for your online audience.\n\nMorph your voice and become your character with fun processing derived from Roland’s famous VT voice transformer products. Adjust the pitch and formant to change your age or gender. Or go even further and take on the persona of a beast or alien.\n\nBRIDGE CAST also includes EQ, compression, and other pro vocal processing to level up your streams. A low-cut filter softens pesky “P” and “T” plosives, while the de-esser cleans up harsh “S” tones. There’s a noise suppressor to throttle background distractions, plus reverb to launch your voice into another dimension. And with the muscular hardware DSP handling the audio load, all your computer power is dedicated to gaming and streaming.\n\nImmerse yourself in 5.1 or 7.1 virtual surround sound for headphones and stereo speaker systems, powered by advanced Roland technology. Audio is converted from a PC to virtual surround sound via a USB connection, delivering a powerful and engaging sound experience.\n\nSlay your competition by highlighting important game sounds with Game EQ presets. Pinpoint audio frequencies and boost their levels to make it easier to hear critical elements, like enemy footsteps in first-person shooter games. You can even fine-tune while visually monitoring the analyzed waveform in real time. Once you find the ideal settings for different game titles, save them in onboard profiles and call them up with quick button presses while playing.\n\nBuilding your brand is an essential part of creating an online following. Choose your core BRIDGE CAST look with bold Black and Ice White finish options. And take it to another level by customizing the detachable faceplate using our downloadable skin template, which allows you to personalize the panel with your team or gamertag design. It’s also possible to customize the LED colors of the four control knobs for additional flair.\n\nThe ergonomic BRIDGE CAST panel lets you easily control your mix while staying focused on the game. Everything you need is at your fingers, including grab-and-go level knobs and assignable buttons for muting sounds and accessing various functions. The rock-solid design won’t move around on your desktop, and the discrete rear-panel connections keep clutter in check.\n\nThe powerful BRIDGE CAST app works in tandem with the hardware, giving you full access to an array of in-depth features. Dial in mic and audio parameters, configure Game EQ presets, and more. You can also re-assign hardware controls for your needs and save/recall custom BRIDGE CAST configurations for different games and streaming audiences.\n\nUsing the BRIDGE CAST app, effortlessly tailor your sound with intuitive microphone settings for speed and precision. The version 5.00 update allows you to adjust EQ with quick-access controls and use the studio-grade compressor to achieve a clean, professional vocal sound with a single fader. There's also an expander that minimizes unwanted background noise without unnatural artifacts.\n\nWith BGM CAST, adding background music and sonic color to streams has never been easier. Available through the BRIDGE CAST app and Roland Cloud, BGM CAST puts a growing selection of royalty-free background music and sound effects at your fingertips. Choose music by mood and genre or create playlists of your favorites for stress-free music management. You can also assign sound effects to the four hardware buttons for instant triggering.\n\nA free Roland Account provides 36 background music tracks and 16 sound effects to use at no charge. Signing up for Roland Cloud Core membership through the BRIDGE CAST app unlocks thousands of additional music tracks and hundreds of sound effects, with new selections added each month. Membership also includes powerful tools for modern music creators, including the ZENOLOGY synthesizer, Zenbeats production software, Sound Packs, and more.\n\nGet the BRIDGE CAST App\n\nIf you need a unified audio and video solution, be sure to check out BRIDGE CAST X.

      "description": "Level up your gaming and streaming sound with BRIDGE CAST ONE, a compact livestreaming audio mixer with hands-on controls. Gain a competitive advantage with powerful features like dual bus mixes, vocal transformer effects, fast-access presets, and support for a broadcast-grade mic and headphones. For even more control, the companion BRIDGE CAST app offers extended audio tools and royalty-free background music and sound effects through BGM CAST on Roland Cloud.\n\nWatch how the streamlined audio tools in BRIDGE CAST ONE make it easy to upgrade your streams with enhanced sound quality and real-time controls.\n\nWith BRIDGE CAST ONE, your online sound is always on par with your gameplay. Backed by 50 years of Roland AV technology, it gives you all the essentials for mixing streams with professional quality. Sleek, multi-function controls provide instant access to vital functions, supported by a deep selection of extended tools in the BRIDGE CAST app.\n\nA great mic is key if you want to sound like a pro. Chat and broadcast online with crystal-clear audio using a high-quality dynamic or condenser microphone connected to the XLR input. The onboard preamp delivers rich, dynamic sound, eliminating the need for external preamps or costly mic activators. Set up is simple with mic rehearsal mode—just follow the quick-start guide in the app. It’s also possible to connect a headset mic via the mini headphone jack.\n\nThe pro audio tools in BRIDGE CAST ONE mean you’ll always keep your audience engaged and your teammates aligned. Quickly manage game sounds and chat audio with a single multi-function knob. Stream clear sound with EQ, compression, noise suppression, and other tools. Add spaciousness with a high-quality reverb effect.\n\nBalance Mode makes it easier to adjust game and chat volumes. It functions like a fader on an audio mixer, enabling you to control both channels smoothly. You can set volume limits for each channel in the app, ensuring a proper balance even if the default game or chat audio is too loud, so you can focus on the game.\n\nEffortlessly tailor your sound within the BRIDGE CAST app with intuitive microphone settings for speed and precision. With the Version 5.00 update, you can adjust EQ with quick-access controls and use the studio-grade compressor to achieve a clean, professional vocal sound with a single fader. There's also an expander that minimizes unwanted background noise without unnatural artifacts.\n\nEnhance game sounds and dominate your competition with customizable Game EQ presets. You can even fine-tune while visually monitoring the analyzed waveform in real time. Call up a custom mix highlighting crucial audio elements, or craft a distinct stream mix to boost your online interaction. A limiter also automatically lowers loud game sounds like gunshots and explosions, reducing ear strain during long sessions.\n\nEnvelop yourself in your adventures with 5.1 or 7.1 virtual surround sound for headphones and stereo speaker systems, powered by advanced Roland technology. Audio is converted from a PC to virtual surround sound via a USB connection, providing a powerful and immersive sound experience. Use the BRIDGE CAST app to customize the virtual speaker angles and effortlessly shape your sound.\n\nBRIDGE CAST ONE features cutting-edge voice morphing technology derived from Roland's renowned VT vocal transformer products. Effortlessly morph your voice to alter your age or gender and match your avatar. Or take on the character of a beast or alien.\n\nThe companion BRIDGE CAST app is filled with features that seamlessly integrate with the hardware.

      "description": "DJs don’t just play music—they’re also often the MC, livestream producer, sound tech, and remixer, and sometimes the event organizer too. This hefty workload means they need equipment that supports much more than simply mixing songs together. Say hello to the Roland DJ-707M, an integrated livestreaming sound console, multi-purpose audio interface, loudspeaker management system, and fully fledged performance DJ controller that’s equipped to handle the demanding audio needs of any type of DJ.\n\nThe DJ-707M leverages the DSP of Roland’s digital audio consoles to ensure you deliver the loudest, cleanest sound possible—whether it’s with your own PA system or the one already at the venue. Whatever the gig, your clients will remember great sound thanks to features that handle the unexpected, like laptop crashes, surprise guest performers, videographer feeds, and painful audio challenges such as feedback.\n\nUsing the 10 onboard scenes, you can create ‘go-to’ event settings for audio routing, loudspeaker management and system setups—and recall them instantly. Scenes are a huge timesaver for standard event configurations, letting you switch settings for your different speaker systems and recall custom setups for venues where you play regularly.\n\nMaster, booth, and zone outputs all have independent loudspeaker management settings, including four-band EQ, multiband compression, limiter, and mono mode. It’s like having three speaker management processors built into one unit.\n\nFeedback at a gig is dangerous as it can ruin a special speech or even plague the whole event. Built-in feedback suppression listens out for feedback—and even anticipates it—before adjusting the speaker output automatically.\n\nConnect two computers at once for a backup laptop connection or seamless DJ changeover. The USB B port also works as a standard USB audio interface capable of two-way communication with an iOS device, perfect for streaming to your favorite social media platform or playing a mix from your phone.\nLearn More About Livestreaming\n\nWhen an event includes a guest musician or performer, you can easily plug them into the front-facing dual 1/4-inch jacks or 1/8-inch stereo aux input without disrupting your DJ configuration.\n\nThe fully assignable zone output with dedicated level control is ideal for creating a separate mix for a videographer, sending different music to another area of the venue, or even adding a subwoofer.\n\nThe compact DJ-707M is packed with more specifications than bulkier controllers that don’t fit in tight DJ booths and are hard to transport without an equipment van.\n\nYou can’t work if your DJ controller isn’t working. Which is why the DJ-707M is built for life on the road, with rugged, reinforced metal parts both inside and out.\n\nThe DJ-707M’s size fits perfectly between turntables and DJ media players. And it’s Serato DVS Upgrade Ready, so you can use it as the ultimate mobile DJ mixer with your component setup.\n\nDJs know that really rocking an event means sounding great on the mic. The DJ-707M’s mic section is designed to handle any situation, from straightforward speeches and announcements to pitch-corrected karaoke throwdowns.\n\nWith the DNA of a professional audio console, the DJ-707M features studio-quality microphone preamps with independent gain, low-cut, and noise gate on each channel.\n\nIndividual on/off, level, three-band EQ, and effect controls let you get the exact right sound for each microphone. And with dedicated hardware effects from clean reverbs and delays to key-based auto-pitching and auto-ducking, you have total command over your vocal sounds.\n\nFor flexibility when you need it, the front-facing aux inputs can be used with microphones—just flip the switch to MIC for the correct level and impedance. This gives you a total of four mic inputs, enough for the whole party to sing along!\n\nAfter all the event planning, set up, speeches, and introductions, you still need to rock the spot and get the crowd dancing. The DJ-707M lets you fully express your skills as a DJ, combining deep Serato DJ Pro integration with creative tools that you’ll only find on Roland DJ controllers.\n\nWith full Serato DJ Pro support, you can use hot cues, loops, rolls, pitch play, slicer, and more. Serato DJ Pro also comes with iZotope audio effects to stylize your sound with simple one-knob control.\n\nWork the perfect scratch or smoothest blend using the rugged crossfader with full-range curve settings and software-adjustable crossfader margin.\n\nRoland’s pristine-sounding hardware effects can be assigned individually to the dedicated Filter/FX knob on each channel, and include Filter, Dub Echo, Jet, Noise, Reverb, Delay, Bit Crush, Phaser, Noise 2, and more.\n\nThere’s a Roland TR drum machine tucked away on Deck 3, so you can accent your songs with classic TR-808 and 909 drum loops or even provide a backing beat for instrumentalists. Setting Deck 4 to OSC lets you drop sweepers, synth stabs, and other onboard DJ sound effects to spice up a mix.\n\nThe Roland DJ-707M DJ Controller for Mobile DJs is an integrated live sound console, loudspeaker management system, and fully-fledged performance Serato DJ Pro controller that’s equipped to handle the demanding audio needs of working Mobile DJs.\n\nAs livestreaming has quickly become a way of life for DJ's to maintain their skill and entertain those at home, the Roland DJ-707M unlocks livestreaming with an iOS device using the second USB port.\n\nThe DJ-707M is a controller that doubles as a tool for mixing, streaming, and music performance. Learn to utilize its many advanced features.Read more…\n\nA good DJ set is like a story with ups and downs and twists and turns. Here are a few tips to help you create an engaging set and nail it.Read more…\n\nRoland TR Drum Machines Now Sync with Serato DJ PRORead more…\n\nRhythm Performer Meets Sound Designer\n\nThe TR-8 is a performance rhythm machine that melds the legendary sound and vibe of the TR-808 and TR-909 with features and functions for the modern age.\n\nThe Legendary TR-909 Sound in the Palm of Your Hand\n\nThe Legendary Boom and Sizzle of the Most Famous Drum Machine Ever Made—Now in an Affordable and Modern Format\n\nCompatible with Apple Mac series (Intel-based).\nCompatible with Apple Silicon Mac (using the M1 chip).\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "The FP-E50 brings you a premium digital piano experience—and so much more. This fun portable instrument is filled with Roland’s top technologies, providing a complete creative hub for learning, performing, and writing music.\n\nDevelop and perform authentic piano techniques with the SuperNATURAL Piano engine and 88 weighted-action keys. Explore synthesizers, orchestral voices, and more with the advanced ZEN-Core sound engine, backed by interactive accompaniments that put you in control of a full band. Connect a mic and sing with vocal effects and real-time harmonies. And go further with Bluetooth® audio/MIDI support, onboard recording, computer connectivity, and numerous expansion options on Roland Cloud.\n\nWith its all-in-one mobile design, the FP-E50 lets you realize ambitious creative visions anywhere. And thanks to the intuitive interface, it’s easy to stay focused on what’s most important—making music.\n\nThe attractive FP-E50 offers all the core features that have made the award-winning FP digital piano series so popular worldwide. It travels easily in and out of the home, while onboard stereo speakers project immersive sound everywhere you play. Connect to external speakers for more sound coverage if needed when performing. Or plug in headphones and keep the music all to yourself.\n\nWhile the FP-E50 is filled with advanced features, getting around on the instrument is frustration free. The top-level display shows sound, tempo, and other essential information, and the clean panel layout provides direct access to sound selection, favorite tones, keyboard transposition, and more. Many buttons include long-press functions, allowing you to save settings or tweak deeper parameters without menu diving. And with Scenes, you can instantly recall complete setups for the entire keyboard using single actions.\n\nCombining expressive FP piano features with advanced Roland keyboard and vocal technologies, the FP-E50 gives you a powerful range of musical tools to perform any style with passion.\n\nWhether you’re new to the piano or an experienced player, the FP-E50 provides a rich foundation for learning, practicing, and performing. Roland’s SuperNATURAL Piano sound engine offers the authentic feel and interactive response of an acoustic grand, enabling you to draw out endless tonal colors with your playing dynamics. The 88 full-size keys complete the experience, with hammer action, escapement, and Ivory Feel material providing the same touch beneath your fingers as a world-class acoustic instrument.\n\nThe FP-E50 also features the expandable ZEN-Core sound engine, the same advanced sound generator used in professional Roland synthesizers like JUPITER-X and FANTOM. Explore historic Roland synth sounds, brass and orchestral voices, guitars and basses, world sounds, drums, and many others. Using simple controls, you can freely layer piano and ZEN-Core tones or assign different sounds to the left and right hands.\n\nWith its intelligent auto-accompaniment tools, the FP-E50 puts a full band sound at your command. Choose from nearly 200 onboard music styles newly created by professional composers. Drive arrangements with your left-hand fingering, from easy one-note triggering for beginners to full-chord detection for advanced players. Interactive mode makes things even more fun, letting you guide the volume and energy of the backing based on how you play. And with the Chord Sequencer function, you can improvise and develop melodies over colorful preset chord progressions that automatically follow the accompaniment.\n\nSing along with keyboard performances using the FP-E50’s mic input and studio-grade vocal effects. Liven up the sound with rich ambience and tighten things up with the compressor and noise suppressor. Perform with impressive real-time harmonies that magically follow the chords you play. Or surprise audiences with voice transformer effects that change your gender or turn you into a funky robot. There’s even a vocoder for creating vintage electronic voices and choir sounds that you guide with notes on the keyboard.\n\nTake your FP-E50 experience further with Roland Cloud expansion, Bluetooth audio/MIDI support, onboard recording, and USB connectivity with music software on computers and mobile devices.\n\nOn Roland Cloud, there’s an ever-expanding selection of FP-E50 content to discover. Grow your accompaniment library with Z-Style Packs, a new range of professionally crafted styles and companion tone setups for popular music styles and regional genres around the world. EXZ Wave Expansions and SDZ Sound Packs are also available, allowing you to expand and customize the ZEN-Core sound engine with genuine Roland sounds and curated content from leading sound designers.\n\nExplore Z-Style Packs\n\nBuilt-in Bluetooth lets you easily integrate your smartphone or tablet with the FP-E50. Wirelessly stream songs from your music library through the keyboard’s sound system and play along. Follow instructional piano videos on the web. And use Bluetooth MIDI to work with music production apps like Roland Zenbeats and many others.\n\nThe FP-E50’s flexible audio recorder allows you to capture a song performance one step at a time, including the auto-accompaniment, left and right hands, and a vocal. After you’re satisfied, save your masterpiece to internal memory for on-demand playback or a USB flash drive for sharing. The FP-E50 also includes a USB audio/MIDI interface to develop your FP-E50 recordings further and compose new pieces in computer music production software.\n\nThe Roland Piano App extends the FP-E50 experience with wireless remote operation from your smartphone or tablet. Adjust basic functions with a touch and explore key split, transposition, and other advanced features. Customize sounds with the powerful Piano Designer. Browse songs on Roland Cloud and call up digital scores to learn them at your own pace. Develop your rhythm with the visual metronome. And motivate yourself with an activity log with goals, flash card games, and more.\n\nRoland Piano App support requires FP-E50 Version 1.20 or later (available on the Downloads tab). Some app features are not accessible with the FP-E50.\n\nLearn More\n\nRoland offers many stand and pedal options to suit how you use the FP-E50. For piano-focused playing at home, the KSFE50 stand and KPD-70 pedal unit create a unified upright look with integrated sustain, soft, and sostenuto pedals.

      "description": "Do you have a passion for music? GO:KEYS 3 makes it easy to go from being a fan to an active music creator. This fun modern keyboard unlocks a simple new approach to making music, encouraging you to explore sounds and ideas in the moment—no previous experience required. Just power on, push a few buttons, and let your imagination flow. And as your skills develop, deeper features allow you to travel as far as your ambition takes you.\n\nWith GO:KEYS 3 under your fingers, you have everything you need to turn your musical dreams into reality.\n\nLearning music doesn’t have to be hard. GO:KEYS 3 invites exploration at every turn, urging your inner creative voice to emerge. The friendly, interactive interface stimulates discovery and spontaneous musical moments, even if you’ve never played an instrument before.\n\nAs many top composers will tell you, playing one note with an inspiring sound is often all it takes to spark a complete idea. GO:KEYS 3 includes over 1000 sounds from Roland’s historic library, which has motivated top music artists in every genre for over 50 years. Journey through a universe of possibilities with the expressive 61-note keyboard, from acoustic pianos and orchestral instruments to modern synthesizers, guitars, drums, and beyond.\n\nOnce you find a sound that energizes you, experiment by creating melodies and arpeggios over automatic musical backing. GO:KEYS 3 is filled with ready-made chord progressions in various styles, all with the immersive sound of a finished record. It’s also possible to craft your own chord sequences, and you can easily find the progressions for your favorite songs online or with dedicated apps.\n\nAs a chord progression loops, discover your own performance style by remixing sounds. Change things up with four variations. Drop parts in and out, including the drums, bass, and backing chords. Swap instruments for a different vibe. And create dynamic energy by processing the entire sound with filtering, lo-fi tones, beat slicing, and other ear-catching performance effects.\n\nAfter you’ve mastered chord progressions, go even further by directing a band of virtual musicians. GO:KEYS 3 offers a wide selection of dynamic accompaniments controlled by one or two left-hand fingers. Jam melodies and solos with your right hand as the band backs every move. Then weave in more sophisticated textures with full left-hand chords as your technique grows.\n\nAt any time, you can instantly capture what you’re doing with GO:KEYS 3 and listen back. Analyze and hone your ideas. Show off your progress with family and friends. Or share your skills with the world on social media.\n\nWith its portable, all-in-one design, you can pick up GO:KEYS 3 and enjoy music anywhere in your living space. The built-in stereo sound system delivers rich, satisfying sound, while support for AA battery power makes setup fast and easy. And when you want to play privately, plug in headphones or earbuds to enjoy GO:KEYS 3 without disturbing others.\n\nListening to your favorite music is a great way to inspire the next creative session. Play songs from your music library via Bluetooth or USB memory and jam along. Then, use the center cancel function to remove the vocals and sing them yourself. GO:KEYS 3 also supports Bluetooth MIDI and audio/MIDI over USB, opening the door to further creative possibilities with music apps on a computer or mobile device.\n\nWant more inspiration? On Roland Cloud, there’s an ever-growing selection of premium sounds and exciting new arranger styles to explore. GO:KEYS 3 also supports Roland Cloud Connect, an optional wireless adapter that lets you browse, audition, and download Roland Cloud content from your smartphone.\n\nWhen you’re ready to take the next step in your musical journey, Melodics Essentials for Roland is the perfect partner to extend the GO:KEYS experience. Available on Roland Cloud for an exclusive discounted price, this free-flowing app from Melodics makes learning fun and engaging with a unique visual approach to music education.\n\n•  GO:KEYS 3 Turquoise\n   •  GO:KEYS 3 Dark Red\n   •  GO:KEYS 3 Midnight Blue\n\nGO:KEYS 5 offers all the features of GO:KEYS 3, plus additional tools to take your creative ambitions even further.

      "description": "Playing the piano is one of life’s most rewarding experiences, whether teaching yourself or watching your family discover a passion for music. Roland’s HP700 series supports your ambitions with gorgeous piano sound, sophisticated styling, and helpful features that’ll keep you coming back for more. And with the flexibility and expression to suit any genre or playing standard, you’ll have an instrument that grows with you. Whatever your reasons for owning a piano, the HP700 series can help fulfill them—bringing style, culture, and music into the heart of your home.\n\nAn HP700 piano can be the centerpiece of a room—or so discreet you hardly know it’s there. For silent practice day or night, connect headphones and enjoy immersive sound that won’t disturb your family or neighbors. For interactive study, wirelessly connect the piano with your smartphone via Bluetooth® and play along with your favorite tunes or sharpen your skills with online tutorials. For performance, adjust the volume-controllable internal speakers to fill the room with music. And when you’re not playing, you can use the HP700 piano as your home entertainment system, streaming music with clear, detailed highs and rich, powerful lows.\n\nThe Headphones 3D Ambience feature makes your playing sound like it’s coming from the heart of the piano, providing a rich, immersive experience for your private music sessions.\n\nWith built-in Bluetooth wireless audio support, you can stream music from your smartphone through the piano’s powerful internal speakers—perfect for social gatherings and practice sessions.\n\nPractice sessions are fun and productive when you play along with the vast selection of onboard tunes. Choose from classical, pop, and jazz pieces, complete with full orchestral accompaniment.\n\nStudying piano doesn’t have to mean endless work. Just five minutes of focused daily practice can improve your playing—especially with the Roland Piano App. It runs on your smartphone or tablet and communicates with the piano via Bluetooth, so it’s always ready for action. Find your favorite tunes, play along, and record your performance or practice session. Then listen back to assess the areas that need attention, even when you’re away from the piano. It’s the fast-track route to better playing and way more enjoyable than just practicing over and over.\n\nThe One Week Master program guides you through learning a piece of music in just seven days. Choose from the large variety of folk, jazz, and classical pieces in your HP700 series piano, and then start the challenge.\n\nFrom the app, you can browse the piano’s song library, listen to selections, and call up sheet music to learn them yourself. Slow the tempo to go at your own pace and mute the left- or right-hand part as needed to focus on each hand individually.\n\nThe app’s Timeline feature logs each practice session with your HP700 piano, making it easy to keep track of how often you’re playing.\n\nStaying inspired is the key to enjoying any musical instrument, and the HP700 series gives you the touch, tone, and features to explore a variety of musical genres and playing styles. The responsive keyboard and powerful sound engine deliver authentic piano performance, supporting you during first steps right through to developing professional techniques.\n\nUnlike most digital pianos, the HP700 series features SuperNATURAL Piano Modeling, an advanced technology that reproduces the complex physical interactions that occur when an acoustic piano creates sound. You’ll hear—and feel—the difference in every note you play.\n\nThe Hybrid Keyboard combines the beautiful look and familiar feel of a wooden keyboard with the durability of modern molded materials, eliminating regular maintenance costs.\n\nThe Progressive Damper Action pedal accurately replicates the damper pedal behavior of an acoustic piano, enabling traditional techniques like half-pedaling,\n\nAs a parent, nothing beats watching your child discover a creative new hobby. When you choose the right piano, you’ll give them a passion for life and help them to appreciate music while teaching them how to overcome challenges and achieve goals. Find out why the HP700 series is the perfect first step on their musical journey.\n\nMake a bold statement—or keep things subtle. Taking inspiration from the elegant and curvaceous cabinets of traditional pianos—with a modern twist—the HP series brings sophistication to any home or décor. Plus, with compact dimensions, a smaller footprint, and lighter weight than a traditional acoustic, you can move your HP700 piano around until you find the perfect spot.\n\nTimeless and elegant cabinet designs that satisfy modern tastes.\n\nWith the control panel concealed beneath the keyboard lid, each HP piano has a streamlined look that won’t distract you during a performance.\n\nBacked by Roland’s advanced sound technology, the onboard speakers deliver dynamic, full-range sound during practice, performance, or parties.\n\nChildren thrive when learning a musical instrument, and choosing the right one helps spark their passion and keeps them playing. With expressive tones that bring the music to life and a responsive keyboard at their fingertips, an HP700 series piano ensures they stay inspired and keen to improve—especially when they hook up the piano to their smartphone and play along to their favorite music. Introducing the Roland HP700 series: pianos to inspire your child’s creativity.\n\nBetween school, clubs, and homework, kids lead hectic lives—which makes it tough to find time for piano practice. While playing an acoustic piano can disturb others, the HP700 series lets your children either reduce the volume or plug in headphones and concentrate on learning piano while family life goes on around them. It’s the flexible solution that lets them play any time they like.\n\nOpen the lid and the piano is ready to play—no need to press the power button. The controls are directly in the line of sight, so kids can glance down, find what they need, and focus on their practice. The HP704’s music rest is also angle-adjustable to match your child’s sitting height, letting them get comfortable and dive into the music.\n\nHeadphones are especially useful for young musicians, letting them practice at any time of the day or night. Thanks to the Headphones 3D ambience feature, they’ll experience the immersive acoustic effect of playing in a real concert hall without disturbing anyone else. And with the volume limit function, you can set the maximum volume of the phones or onboard speakers to ensure their hearing is always protected.\n\nThe Roland Piano App can track your child’s daily playing, giving you instant updates on their progress. It’s a great way to bond with your child over their new hobby while taking part in their musical journey and encouraging them to keep going.\n\nTimeline lets you check the tunes your child has played and view how long they’ve practiced. And with the recording function, you can listen back to their performance using your smartphone or tablet.\n\nIt’s great for young musicians to have targets, and the One Week Master program helps your child learn a piece of music in just seven days. With the HP700’s song collection spanning many genres, they’re sure to find something that inspires them, while you follow their progress using the app.\n\nFor your child to improve, it’s important that they practice between piano lessons. And with the HP700 series, that doesn’t have to mean boring exercises. With a variety of built-in tutorial features, the HP700 series makes learning so much fun that you’ll never have to persuade your child to practice.\n\nThe Do Re Mi lesson feature substitutes the usual piano notes with spoken phrases (do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do), allowing your child to learn scales by singing along with the onboard tunes. To make it even easier and more fun, use the Roland Piano App to display the digital music score on your smartphone or tablet. In addition, learning to play in time to a beat is the first step towards your child performing music with others, and the HP700’s built-in metronome provides an essential tool to help develop their sense of rhythm.\n\nWhen your child sits alongside you—or their piano teacher—you can divide the keyboard into left and right areas, so that two people can play in the same note ranges. It’s a great tutorial aid that makes it easy for your child to copy what you demonstrate. It also provides a convenient way for two children to practice at the same time.\n\nWhen your child finds the musical genre that sparks their passion, practice sessions become a pleasure. Each HP700 piano contains over 380 songs ranging from classical and pop to jazz, with arrangements and skill levels to match their playing standard.\n\nLet your child discover tunes from popular modern genres or sharpen their classical skills with 287 piano études from legends like Charles-Louis Hanon, complete with full orchestral accompaniment.\n\nAlong with its powerful education tools, the Roland Piano App provides access to interactive scores for the HP700’s song library.\n\nIt’s frustrating to invest in an entry-level piano only to realize that its feel and tone are holding your child back. But with the HP700 series, they’ll be supported along every step of their musical journey. Authentic tones and a welcoming feel provide first-timers with great sound and the inspiration to keep going. And as their skills develop, these pianos really keep up. When you choose the HP700 series, you’re choosing an instrument that will last.\n\nThe HP704 provides the style, performance, and pristine sound projection you’d expect from a premium studio piano. With its sleek, sophisticated cabinet design, this digital piano makes a statement wherever you play it—and a range of finishes ensures it fits in anywhere. The advanced PHA-50 keyboard, onboard tutorial features, and Bluetooth connectivity with music apps mean you’ll always be inspired to play, explore and improve. And the tall, elegant cabinet houses a powerful four-speaker audio system that delivers dynamic, room-filling sound as you perform—or while you relax by streaming your favorite tunes.\n\nA great-sounding piano must look good too. From the tall-yet-slim cabinet to the elegant front legs and sophisticated curves based on the design concept of the Roland’s flagship LX Series, the HP704 draws you in and compels you to start playing. Each finish has been carefully selected and meticulously manufactured, so you can choose a piano that truly looks at home in your living room. Also, the cabinet is designed to deliver the best possible sound, regardless of where the piano is situated. Available in polished ebony, charcoal, dark rosewood, light oak and white.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPiano bench may vary by region.\n\nWhen it comes to the wish list for your new piano, playing ‘feel’ should be a priority. Whether building basic skills or expressing yourself in a demanding performance, the HP704 ‘s responsive PHA-50 keyboard reacts to your touch—putting you in control and keeping you inspired.  You’ll also appreciate the blend of artisan tradition and cutting-edge technology—sleek wooden sides give each white key a familiar feel, while the durable inner frame ensures maintenance-free reliability over years of daily playing.\n\nA great sound makes you play better. The HP704’s SuperNATURAL technology captures the essence of an acoustic piano in every note. And as you play, your performance comes to life through an advanced four-speaker Acoustic Projection System that delivers sparkling highs, warm lows, and everything in-between. The four speakers are configured as two pairs inside the instrument, and each pair is optimized to deliver superior sound reproduction across the piano’s vast dynamic range. Whether you’re playing or streaming music, you’ll hear every note in immersive, crystal-clear sound.\n\nUnified practice and remote control app for Roland home pianos.\n\nWith the Piano Designer app, you can easily control many elements from the graphical touchscreen on your mobile device.\n\nPremium Closed-Back Studio Headphones for Pro Level Monitoring.\n\nPremium Open-Air Headphones with a Wide Range of Applications.\n\nEnjoy All the Dynamics of Your Digital Piano, Day or Night.\n\nHeadphones for Everyday Music Making and Audio Playback.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.\n\nThe affordable HP702 brings style and premium piano performance into your home. Practice at midnight, immersed in sound from the Headphones 3D Ambience feature. Wirelessly stream songs and app audio via Bluetooth or try the onboard tutorials and improve your playing skills. Whatever the musical scenario, the HP702 delivers a superior piano experience—for far less than you think.\n\nThe compact HP702 fits in any living room or apartment, complementing your décor with its clean lines, natural finish, and sleek curves. Traditional and timeless with a contemporary twist, the versatile HP702 makes a stylish statement without shouting. Available in charcoal, dark rosewood, light oak, and white finishes.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPiano bench may vary by region.\n\nFrom beginners to seasoned performers, the HP702’s PHA-4 Standard keyboard brings out the best of your playing. And with fast-key repetition and high-resolution sensing, this responsive keyboard was designed to satisfy the most demanding pianists—so you won’t need to upgrade as your technique improves.

      "description": "Produce and perform music anywhere, anytime—without clutter or complications. The MC-101 GROOVEBOX has all the high-quality sounds, sequencing, and effects of the expansive MC-707 in a compact four-track version that’s go-everywhere portable. Get started with an inspiring collection of ready-to-go sounds and patterns, or easily create your own. Craft a unique style by importing custom sounds, loops, and clips that sync to tempo. And you can perform with the MC-101, triggering clips and shaping your sounds with direct, hands-on control.\n\nThe MC-101 is a professional production tool, sharing the sounds and many of the capabilities of its bigger sibling, the MC-707. And there are advantages to being small. The MC-101 is solid-yet-light and runs for about five hours on four AA batteries, so you can design sounds, create drum patterns, and compose musical phrases just about anywhere. And it’s not just a scratch pad for simple ideas. You can produce fully fledged professional tracks or create backing tracks and accompaniment for live performance.\n\nThe MC-101 has a four-track sequencer optimized for creating today’s electronic and dance-focused music. You can use the 16 RGB pads to create drum, bass, and synthesizer patterns and produce your own original music. Explore a musical playground where you can freely combine loops and one-shots with melodic phrases, including your own MIDI sequences and imported audio recordings. Compose and chain scenes or clips, rearrange, re-sample, record automation, and more. Or share clips with other MC-101, MC-707, and VERSELAB MV-1 users for remote collaboration.\n\nThe MC-101 uses the ZEN-Core Synthesis System—the most advanced synth engine we’ve ever made. ZEN-Core delivers the Roland sounds that have defined electronic and dance genres for over forty years. Legendary instruments like the TR-808, TR-909, JUNO-106, and SH-101 are all here, ready to replicate classic sounds or be combined, tweaked, and processed into entirely new sounds.\nMore About ZEN-Core\n\nCompose from a curated collection of projects with built-in beats, phrases, and sounds, all expertly crafted by renowned artists and sound designers—with even more available to download.\nExplore Projects\n\nThe MC-101 is also compatible with ZEN-Core Sound Packs. So when you’re ready for more sounds, or want to explore new genres and styles, it’s easy to change things up.\nExplore Sounds\n\nEach track contains a powerful sample player so you can import your own custom sounds. Use your own voice or the sound of a favorite instrument from your computer. Imported audio can sync with the MC-101’s tempo or be processed with the arsenal of built-in effects and hands-on controls.\n\nWith the MC-101’s wide range of pro effects, your music sounds polished and fully produced. Each track has independent effects processors with a huge number of variations. Lush chorus brings depth to pads and other synth sounds. Delays and reverbs create evocative spaces and add movement to delicate sequences. Overdrive, distortion, and amp simulation inject grit and intensity into synths, guitars, drums, and more. You can also run your entire mix through master effects like filters, bit-crushers, and a master bus compressor that glues it all together with punch and clarity.\n\nWhen you’re ready to develop tracks further or share your creations with friends and fans, simply connect the MC-101 to your computer with a single USB cable. It has advanced USB audio interface capabilities and can record an entire mix or all four parts to individual tracks in your DAW. Or sample sounds from your DAW to capture backing tracks, stems, or the sound of a favorite software synth for your next live show.\n\nThe MC-101 GROOVEBOX has all the high-quality sounds, sequencing, and effects of the professional MC-707, in a compact four-track version that’s go-everywhere portable.\n\nIn this video, Peter Brown gives you an overview of the beatmaking possibilities of the Roland MC-101. This overview looks at some of the sounds and performance techniques to get you making music anywhere.\n\nDrummer, DJ, and electronic visionary Rusty Egan helped shape Britain's New Romantic pulse—from Visage's \"Fade to Grey\" to the Blitz Club.Read more…\n\nJamie Stewart, the confessional frontperson of experimental rock band Xiu Xiu, explains their love for Roland drum machines.Read more…\n\nStrand of Oaks mastermind Timothy Showalter explains how painting and meditation fueled his shift from folk rock to synth sounds.Read more…\n\nThe GROOVEBOX series continues to evolve, and one of the latest tools for advanced performance is Scene Chain. Learn to maximize the feature.Read more…\n\nThis video manual contains step-by-step instructions that will quickly introduce you to the MC-101’s top features.Read more…\n\nRoland’s ZEN-Core Synthesis System works across hardware and software, delivering decades of genre-defining sounds with the power to shape them in new and exciting ways.Read more…\n\nThe power and flexibility of the ZEN-Core Synthesis System delivers an incredible array of sounds, from analog modelling synths to crystal-clear pianos.Read more…\n\nDesigned and built by V-MODA in collaboration with Roland, the Crossfade M-100 AIRA is an audiophile-quality headphone for users of Roland’s AIRA range of electronic instruments and effects.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.\n\nFor details on how to install the Sound Pack distributed by Roland Cloud, see \"Sound Pack / SVZ File Import Functions Added (Installing a Sound Pack)\".",

Record audio and MIDI—with deep control over timing—and tweak the faders and knobs for that “in the moment” experience. With such massive potential, you’re ready to produce in any style or create your own new thing.\n\nThis modern GROOVEBOX packs a lot of punch in a single piece of gear. It’s deep and customizable, yet fun and friendly, always ready to create something new. Compose from a curated collection of built-in sounds, beats, and phrases all expertly crafted by renowned artists and sound designers. Explore a musical playground where you can freely combine loops and one-shots with melodic phrases, including your own audio recordings and MIDI sequences. Record and share clips, chain Scenes, re-arrange, re-sample, record automation, and make it all sound huge with per-track and global effects.\n\nThe MC-707’s eight-track sequencer is optimized for fluid production of today’s electronic-focused music styles. Quickly build parts with the TR-REC step sequencer found on classic Roland drum machines and use the 16 ultra-sensitive pads to play and record drum parts, melodic basslines, or polyphonic chord progressions. Sequences are stored in clips that contain your sounds and note data, plus real-time or drawn automation for creating effect changes, slow filter sweeps, and much more. You can capture clips in Scenes to perform complete songs, and use creative tools like note repeat, chord designer, and step LFO to supercharge new ideas.\n\nThe MC-707 lets you dig deep into our most advanced synth engine ever—the ZEN-Core Synthesis System. Fusing virtual analog, modeling, and modern PCM, the MC-707 has the sounds of legendary Roland rhythm machines and synthesizers that are the foundation of electronic music, including the TR-808, TR-909, TB-303, JUNO-106, and SH-101. But the MC-707 also looks forward, with modern digital and hybrid sounds perfect for creating future classics today.\nMore About ZEN-Core\n\nIn addition to its deep synthesis engine, the MC-707 has a powerful sampler with on-the-fly recording that synchronizes to your project’s tempo. Record vocals or instrument parts, or import from your own existing library, then sequence or trigger phrases, one-shots, and loops. You can also tweak and mangle samples by slicing, truncating, and reversing—with the inspiration and precision that comes only from hands-on control.\n\nWith the MC-707’s massive effects palette, your music sounds polished and fully produced. All eight tracks have independent effects processors with a huge number of variations. Lush chorus brings depth to pads and other synth sounds. Delays and reverbs create evocative spaces and add movement to delicate sequences. Overdrive, distortion, and amp simulation inject grit and intensity into synths, guitars, drums, and more. You can process external audio and run your entire mix through master effects like filters, bit-crushers, and a master bus compressor that glues it all together with punch and clarity.\n\nLoaded with tactile controls, the MC-707 lets you dig in and shape your music in a visceral, physical way. Faders for each track let you immediately mix and arrange parts, and knobs can be freely assigned to any control you need. You can even record your knob movements so they play back automatically. And the 8x2 pad array is not only great for playing drums and triggering clips—you can generate repeating rhythms, create melodies, constrain to any kind of scale, and trigger complex chords.\n\nWith its advanced USB audio interface capabilities, the MC-707 easily flows in and out of your production setup. You can record all eight parts to individual DAW tracks and finish your song there. Or sample sounds from your DAW to capture backing tracks, stems, or the sound of a favorite software synth for your next live show.\n\nThe MC-707 is an updateable and expandable platform that never gets stale. Keep things fresh with projects that contain new loops, one-shots, phrases, and synth sounds—all available online.\nExplore Projects\n\nAnd since the MC-707 uses the ZEN-Core Synthesis System, you can get loads of new sounds with ZEN-Core Sound Packs, available via Roland Cloud Manager.\nExplore Sounds\n\nThe MC-707 GROOVEBOX has everything you need to create a song or perform a live set without a computer.

      "description": "The MT-90U loads and plays the most popular music-file formats: Standard MIDI File, MP3 and .WAV. You can even change the tempo and pitch of your files, both audio and MIDI. It’s great for sing-along sessions, or for music students who want to slow down fast, complicated licks.\n\nEquipped with a USB port, the MT-90U makes the file-import process quick and easy. Simply load your favorite songs from a USB memory key or connect external devices such as a USB floppy-disk drive or USB-CD drive.\n\nControl the MT-90U from across the room with the wireless remote controller, included. The backlit LCD is easy to see from a distance; it even displays song title, tempo and lyrics of compatible SMF data disks during karaoke sessions.\n\nPortable and fun to use, the MT-90U features icon-based buttons and a backlit LCD, making common operations such as playing songs, muting parts, or changing tempo and musical key easy. Its lightweight design and a built-in grip handle make transport a breeze.\n\nMomentary footswitch for use with keyboards and recording products.\n\nRoland deepens its audio product line with the introduction of three new microphones — two for the stage, one for the studio.\n\nThis is the Roland Digital Piano driver for Microsoft(R) Windows 7.\n\nThis is the Roland Digital Piano driver for Microsoft(R) Windows 7 64-bit Edition.\n\nThis is the Roland Digital Piano driver for Microsoft(R) Windows Vista(TM).\n\nThis is the RD-300GX, RD-300SX, FP-7, FP-4, and V-Piano driver for Microsoft(R) Windows(R) Vista(TM) 64-bit Operating Systems.\n\nThis is the Roland RD driver for Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).\n\nThis is the Roland RD driver for Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard) and earlier.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "The P-6 Creative Sampler packs renowned Roland sampling technology into a pocket-size gadget with sophisticated granular sound design options and a powerful sequencer. Equipped with an onboard mic, intuitive controls, USB-C connectivity, and a versatile stash of hands-on MFX, the P-6 delivers exceptional sampling and performance capabilities anywhere you go.\n\nThe P-6 is ideal for any level of music creator, from beginner to pro. Get started right away with top-level tactile controls and pads for jamming and sound tweaking. Then, go deeper with advanced features for cutting-edge sonic manipulation and performance.\n\nWhether using the built-in mic, analog inputs, or a smartphone via USB-C, the P-6 is always ready to sample at a moment’s notice. After capturing sounds, quickly chop longer samples into preset sections for triggering from the onboard keyboard. Or easily build custom collections of multiple sounds with streamlined Step Sampling. Want to rough up the sound? Get gritty with our trademark lo-fi effects. Need some layers? Resample your creations to add depth and evolving complexity.\n\nStep into a universe of microscopic sound design with the advanced granular sampling tools in the P-6. Transform tiny moments into sonic landscapes with extensive sound design parameters. Detune samples, adjust the grain shape, play with head position, head speed, spread, and more. From clean and pristine to beautifully mangled, it’s easy to conjure new sound dimensions with a twist of a knob or a press of a button.\n\nBreathe life into your sequences with deep features that push the boundaries of music programming. Jam with 64-step patterns powered by dynamic sequencing elements like motion recording, probability, micro-timing, off-grid sequencing, and sub steps. Plus, manipulate playback in real-time with Step Loop for instant stutter effects and creative improvisation.\n\nSupercharge performances and production with an array of curated, hands-on MFX. Transform and manipulate your sounds with legendary effects and a selection of new classics. Grab and go with favorites like Vinyl Simulator, DJFX Looper, Stopper, Lo-fi, Scatter, Phaser, and Resonator. Using BUS FX routing, selectively apply MFX or assign delay and reverb independently to any sample.\n\nThe P-6 SampleTool software for macOS and Windows is a handy companion for editing and transferring samples from your computer to the P-6. Clean up clicks with snap to zero, truncate to remove unwanted sections, normalize to standardize audio levels, and downsample for reduced sample resolution. When you’re ready, simply drag and drop the samples directly to the P-6 hardware for seamless integration and playback.\n\nThe P-6 is immensely fun as a standalone instrument but becomes even more powerful when connected to other devices. Build a portable creative ecosystem by linking with the S-1 Tweak Synth, T-8 Beat Machine, and other AIRA Compacts or gadget instruments. Take it further by streaming your entire gadget chain from the P-6 to a smartphone, tablet, or laptop over USB-C for content creation or easy integration with your favorite music software. The setup is plug-and-play, with no driver installation needed.\n\nThe P-6 is as portable as it gets, ready to record anywhere you like. Create freely with up to three hours of lithium-ion battery life per charge, supported by a rugged Roland build that assures years of enjoyment ahead.\n\nCreate infectious tracks in seconds flat with a miniature rhythm factory powered by pristine TR drums plus bass from the inimitable TB-303.\n\nPairing a powerful chord sequencer with the lavish tones of the legendary JUNO-60, this portable synth toolbox has the building blocks you need to bring harmonic substance to your jams.\n\nThis outrageously jammable effects box harmonizes, auto-pitches, vocodes, loops, and glitches your voice and anything else you feed it.\n\nDivine a new world of sonic textures with a potent micro polysynth and sound design playground inspired by the legendary SH-101.\n\nThe P-6 Creative Sampler joins the AIRA Compact gang, packing legendary Roland sampling technology into a compact, user-friendly gadget.\n\nIn this tutorial, Dustin Good explores the P-6’s powerful features and offers tips for mastering this wildly jammable instrument.\n\nLearn how the pandemic-born music organization provides “inclusive, real-world creative arts experiences\" in this exclusive conversation.Read more…\n\nLearn the origin story of vocal harmonizers and processors and explore the science behind creating vocal harmonies with music technology.Read more…\n\nThe multifaceted artist discusses his career encompassing everything from jazz-inflected percussion to art installations.Read more…\n\nJoin the 404 Day worldwide takeover with community-driven SP-powered events, showcases, workshops, and interactive demos.Read more…\n\nThe P-6 is a compact sampler capable of a wide range of sample processing and compositional techniques.

      "description": "Introducing the 7X7-TR8 Drum Machine Expansion.\n\nTake a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the 7X7-TR8 Drum Machine Expansion.\n\nThe TR-8 Ver.1.20 update adds the sounds of the classic Roland TR-606 to the 7X7-TR8 Drum Machine Expansion.\n\nThe TR-707’s predecessor, the TR-909, was developed as an analog-digital hybrid rather than a fully digital device. As memory chips and digital-to-analog converters were very expensive at the time, there was concern that an all-digital design would make the product unaffordable for too many musicians. Also, while PCM sound generation could produce more realistic drum sounds, it offered little in the way of tone editing.\n\nAfter the TR-909’s release however, digital PCM became the trend for synthesizers and drum machines. We embraced this trend with the TR-707 and TR-727, but expensive memory and lack of high-precision D/A converters resulted in a 25kHz, 8-bit (or 6-bit for some tones) sample playback engine that was primitive by today’s standards. Though the TR-707 and TR-727 were developed primarily for rhythm programming and did not give users the ability to edit their sounds, they were ultimately appreciated for their characteristic lo-fi punch and continue to be sought after to this day.\n\nEven though the TR-707 and TR-727 were primarily digital devices, it would not have been possible to perfectly replicate their sound using samples. Due to the low bit-rates of the original units, quantization noise became a problem, particularly during the sound’s decay. To reduce quantization noise, a clever design was employed where PCM sound was produced using non-decaying waveforms and decay was then introduced in the analog circuitry after being converted. Also, at the time these units were developed, deviations in the clock that triggered the PCM caused differences in pitch, and deviations in the analog circuitry downstream of the D/A converter caused variances in decay characteristics.\n\nTo replicate these sounds for the TR-8, we started with the original PCM wave data found on the classic machines. We then used our ACB process to completely model the PCM output stage, carefully including all of its quirks and instabilities. Modeling the analog envelope and amplifier stages that came after the D/A converter allowed us to implement the “Tune” and “Decay” parameters that are available on the TR-8, but not present on the original units.\n\nAdding the 7X7 Drum Machine Expansion takes the experience of playing a TR-8 to a whole new level. All 30 original TR-707 and TR-727 sounds—each with Tune and Decay controls—open up a whole world of sonic possibilities. Aside from the original TR-707 and TR-727 sounds, the 7X7 expansion includes four new, never-before-heard sounds inspired by the original TR engineers. Modified TR-909 kick and snare take the classic combo into new territory with enhanced attack characteristics. A highly percussive Finger Snap offers an alternative to snares or claps and sounds great when layered. And, in addition to the classic TR hand claps, Big Hand Clap is a new tone inspired by the sound of hundreds of people clapping at once.\n\nOnce expanded with the 7X7, your TR-8 can have all the sounds of a TR-707, 727, 808, 909 and more—newly color-coded by kit for easy selection. And the eight stage flam of the TR-909 and versatile accent behavior of the TR-707 dramatically enhance how you can manipulate the feel of a groove. Any step can have a weak or strong hit, a weak or strong accent, an adjustable flam, step based effects and side chain. All the sounds and behaviors of four iconic TR drum machines, plus the TR-8’s own dynamic swing, rolls, playable faders, and across-the-board tune and decay controls make the TR-8 the most advanced Roland drum machine we’ve ever built.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "Roland drum machines have inspired artists and defined genres for decades. With the Drum Machine Collection, you get five of our most revered rhythm machines from the ’80s, recreated as modern plug-ins with new sound-shaping options and advanced sequencing capabilities. Backed by our Analog Circuit Behavior (ACB) technology, these iconic instruments are brought to life with breathtaking realism in your DAW—and all for one low price.\n\nThe Roland drum machines in this collection have served as the rhythmic backbones for countless tracks over the past 40 years. Their creative impact is undisputed, and they continue to drive modern music across a range of styles. These authentic recreations sound and behave just like the vintage hardware, coupled with advanced programming features and extended sound-shaping options for today’s production styles.\n\nThanks to our proprietary circuit modeling technology, these classics are ready to imbue your tracks with retro energy and fuel tomorrow’s masterpieces. The ACB process involves carefully analyzing original hardware units, circuit diagrams, and other historical data. We then use this information to recreate the authentic circuit behaviors of the vintage instruments—including all their beloved quirks and instabilities—giving these rhythm machines their amazingly lifelike sound and organic response.\n\nTR-808\nReleased in 1980, the TR-808 is one of the most revered and sought-after electronic musical instruments of all time—and its influence only continues to grow. While it dominated the sound of emerging rap and hip-hop styles, new musical genres make heavy use of the 808 sound with its unmistakable boom, snap, and sizzle. The 808’s effect on music is so deep that it’s been name-dropped in famous songs, had albums dedicated to it, bands named after it, and is even the subject of a feature-length documentary film.\n\nTR-606\nThe TR-606 Software Rhythm Composer is a detailed replica of the TR-606 Drumatix from 1981—an underground classic in the famous TR family of rhythm machines. The punchy midrange kicks, popping toms, and sizzling hi-hats were a hit with DIY musicians and have appeared across an array of genres, from ’80s new wave and punk to electronic styles. Today’s musicians continue to seek out the TR-606 for its alternative approach to the Roland TR sound.\n\nTR-909\nReleased in 1983, the influence of the TR-909 drum machine is still heard—and felt—nearly four decades after it was launched. Much like the TR-808’s dominance in rap and hip-hop, the TR-909 left an indelible mark on electronic music styles like techno, house, acid, and industrial. From the “uhn tiss” of its thumpy kick and chunky hi-hats to the snappy snare rolls used in dramatic builds, it’s the sound you hear in your head when you think of hard-driving, floor-shaking dance music.\n\nTR-707\nThe now-famous TR-707 Rhythm Composer was released in 1985. Taking its rightful place next to other classic Roland drum machines, this previously underrated instrument has since appeared on hit tracks in a long list of genres, including synth-pop, acid house, industrial, electro, indie, alternative, and more. Taking inspiration from aftermarket modifications, the massively updated sound-shaping options in the plug-in let you adjust tuning, decay, attack, snappy, gain, sample rate, and more.\n\nTR-727\nRoland introduced the TR-727 Rhythm Composer alongside the TR-707 in 1985. Lesser known but no less loved, this Latin percussion-packed sibling has found its way into a wide range of styles over the decades, from tribal and acid house to pop and techno. And it’s also perfect for afrobeat, reggaeton, and more exotic contemporary styles. This software recreation perfectly nails that vintage vibe, expanded with tuning, decay, and other manipulations that make the creative possibilities bloom.\n\nThe Drum Machine Collection offers sophisticated integration with the Roland TR-8S Rhythm Performer. Adjust the software instrument controls in real time using the array of knobs and sliders on the TR-8S. And instantly send your patterns back and forth between the hardware and the plug-ins.\n\nThe Drum Machine Collection is available with a special Roland Cloud Lifetime Key purchase that offers a significant saving over purchasing each title individually. Roland Cloud is also home to software versions of other vintage Roland instruments plus ZENOLOGY, ZENOLOGY FX, Zenbeats, and other inspiring music tools to back your creative journeys.\n\nStart using the instruments in the Drum Machine Collection for free today with a Roland Cloud 30-day trial membership.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "GALAXIAS brings 50 years of legendary Roland synths and drum machines together into one powerful Super Instrument. Access thousands of iconic sounds and freely combine authentic Roland instruments from vintage to modern. Explore supermassive GALAXIAS Scenes filled with intricate layers and deep macro controls. And discover exciting new worlds with infinite creative possibilities.\n\nRoland has been a pioneer in music technology for over half a century, delivering a continuous stream of influential instruments and effects that have fueled countless hits, defined genres, and driven cultural trends. With GALAXIAS, you can now explore and experience them all in one creative environment. From historic icons such as the JUPITER-8, TR-808, and D-50 to modern instruments like ZENOLOGY GX and SYSTEM-8, GALAXIAS harnesses Roland’s evolving sonic legacy within a single intuitive workflow.\n\nChoose from your favorite Roland synths and drum machines, search specific sound types, or mine the ever-expanding collection of over 25,000 sounds to spark new ideas and build compelling tracks. GALAXIAS puts unlimited albums’ worth of inspiration at your command—from vintage sounds to futuristic hybrid tones—with more added each month.\n\nGALAXIAS lets you layer up to four instruments to create massive sonic superclusters called Scenes. Build an intricate setup of your favorite Roland instruments, such as a full stack of JUPITER and JUNO synths, or multiple eras of TR drum machines locked in perfect sync. Dial in an arpeggiator pattern (or four), quickly define key ranges and macro controls, and then play the whole thing as a single instrument in the studio or on stage.\n\nSeamlessly integrated into GALAXIAS, ZENOLOGY GX delivers over 11,000 genre-defining Roland sounds in one powerful instrument. Layer up to four instances with definable key ranges, sophisticated macro controls, per-layer effects, and creative tools like ARPS and CHORDS. Explore the vast collection of presets or craft your own using 23 authentic oscillator and filter models, over 7,000 PCM waveforms, 11 LFO shapes—including a versatile Step LFO for rhythmic movement—and 90+ effects. From studio to stage, ZENOLOGY GX puts limitless sonic potential at your fingertips.\n\nEvery layer in GALAXIAS has its own key range, transpose, and MIDI input settings. The convenient learn and drag functionality makes it fast and easy to build intricate, layered sounds that are deeply engaging and demand attention.\n\nExperience a new level of expression and playability with the ultra-powerful macro controls in GALAXIAS. Easily assign any instrument, effect, or mix parameter to the 16 color-coded knobs and link them to a MIDI controller for real-time operation. Control multiple parameters at once and manipulate them by hand or via tempo-synced LFOs. And with the Smart Link function, you can define parameter ranges and inversions with one simple action.\n\nIn addition to the formidable effects within each individual instrument, GALAXIAS gives you two insert effects per layer and two global send effects. Choose from the growing collection of authentic Roland and BOSS effects and take your sounds to new frontiers. You can also route layers to external outputs or channels in your DAW for further processing.\n\nGlistening arp patterns, thundering bass lines, and emotive chord progressions are only a few clicks away. Along with the onboard pattern sequencers in many of the individual instruments, GALAXIAS provides a powerful arpeggiator and dynamic chord sequencer on each layer. This feature will grow with more sequencer options and other creative tools in future updates.\n\nThe inspiring GALAXIAS interface has been carefully forged for rapid creativity and instant satisfaction. You don’t need a manual to get going, and it’s easy to go deep to quickly translate your ideas into great-sounding tracks. In fact, GALAXIAS may well be your starting point in every creative session and, paired with your favorite DAW, can take your music to unexplored territory.\n\nWhile GALAXIAS can run as a standalone instrument, it also works as a multichannel plug-in for browsing, playing, and recording directly in your DAW. Arpeggiators, pattern sequencers, and LFOs sync with the master tempo, and you can even drag and drop MIDI and audio directly to tracks with some instruments. And with the future GALAXIAS roadmap, that’s only the beginning.\n\nDelve into a single instrument layer, go deep into the full set of parameters, and get the experience of using the original hardware. With the full-screen Immersive Mode, you can toggle your focus between the entire Scene and an individual instrument or effect using a single click or key command.\n\nOpen GALAXIAS and you’ll find it bursting with instruments, sounds, effects, and creative tools to inspire your music. Powered by Roland Cloud, GALAXIAS takes full advantage of all the instruments and effects that Ultimate membership offers, delivering a sound palette of truly epic proportions.\n\nGALAXIAS is a rapidly evolving platform instrument that will continue to improve with new sounds and capabilities added regularly. With full access to the growing library of Roland instruments and effects—and the ability to search across thousands of sounds in an instant—the GALAXIAS creative journey will only get better with time.\n\nGALAXIAS is available exclusively with Roland Cloud Ultimate membership, which you can try for free with a 30-day all-access trial. Along with providing the fuel for the GALAXIAS environment, Roland Cloud gives you independent access to a universe of creative tools for computer-based music production, including software versions of vintage Roland instruments, ZENOLOGY, Sound Packs, Wave Expansions, Zenbeats, and much more.\n\nJoin Roland Cloud\n\nTry GALAXIAS for free with a Roland Cloud 30-day trial membership.\n\nRoland Future Design Lab lead Paul McCabe, Senior Vice President of Research and Innovation, discusses the group's mission and future.Read more…\n\nTake your sound design into widescreen territory with the GALAXIAS Super Instrument, and learn to craft massive pads for electronic genres.Read more…\n\nBreak down the techniques to create 303-based sounds, complete with step-by-step programming tips and real-world track references.Read more…\n\nThe normally secretive artist took time to discuss the process behind creating their new GALAXIAS Scene Packs.Read more…\n\nLearn about the Tone Explorer concept, challenges, and what might come next from Roland Future Design Lab.Read more…\n\nThe SH-2 is an early synth classic.

Originally played by the late Clive Burr on The Number of the Beast—and performed live since 1982 by the charismatic Nicko McBrain—this kit will have you working on fast sixteenths for hours.\n\nDu Musst (es spielen)\nTranslated as “you have to play it,” this kit recreates the sound of “Du Hast” by Rammstein, as played by Christoph Schneider on the band’s seminal metal album Sehnsucht.\n\nNote: The kits in this collection have been created using the module’s internal instruments and editing tools combined with newly developed samples to reinforce certain drum sounds. Because the original recordings are not used within this collection, these kits should be considered as taking inspiration from the original sounds rather than being exact replicas.\n\nThe owners of the songs referenced above are not affiliated or licensed with Roland.

Custom samples layered with internal drums are also included, providing unique sounds you can’t get anywhere else.\n\nV-Drums Kit Packs are available exclusively through Roland Cloud, the home of an expanding collection of V-Drums content, classic Roland instruments, curated samples, music production tools, and jam tracks to inspire your creative journeys.\n\nDownload Greatest Metal Tracks Vol. 01 today—available with Roland Cloud Ultimate and Pro memberships or a Lifetime Key purchase.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "Released in 1981, the JUPITER-8 is one of the most revered and sought-after polysynths of all time. It appears on countless hit tracks spanning decades, and its lush analog sound is simply unmatched for warm pads, soaring strings, and infectious lead tones. With the JUPITER-8 Software Synthesizer, you get an authentic, down-to-the-circuit-level recreation of this vintage icon for your DAW or SYSTEM-8.\n\nThe JUPITER-8 is perhaps the most desirable analog polysynth ever, with original units going for extremely high prices on the used market. It represents the pinnacle of Roland engineering in the early 1980s, with a gorgeous design, robust build, and extreme sonic flexibility. The instrument’s incredibly warm-yet-clear sound is forever imprinted on the many essential music genres that emerged during its original release. And its influence has never diminished, appearing across a range of styles to this day.\n\nAside from its iconic good looks and roadworthy build, the JUPITER-8 is famous for its unmistakable sound. Each of its eight voices had two stable VCOs with four waveforms to choose from, plus support for cross-modulation and screaming sync sounds. The creamy filter is renowned among synth aficionados with its selectable two- or four-pole low-pass VCF and non-resonant high-pass filter. Add in two envelopes, an onboard arpeggiator, and generous modulation capabilities, and you have the makings of a true legend.\n\nWe’ve used our proprietary circuit modeling technology to bring the JUPITER-8 to life in your DAW or SYSTEM-8. The ACB process involves carefully analyzing original hardware units, circuit diagrams, and other historical data. We then use this information to recreate the authentic circuit behaviors of the vintage instrument, including all the beloved quirks and instabilities. This is what gives the JUPITER-8 Software Synthesizer its breathtakingly lifelike sound and unique character.\n\nWhile developing the JUPITER-8 plug-in, we felt it was important not to veer too far from the original’s classic workflow and sonic majesty. But we couldn’t resist adding a few modern touches like making it velocity sensitive, extending the oscillator range, adding an effects section, and enhancing the onboard arpeggiator for extra flexibility. The LFO, arpeggiator, and effects conveniently sync to tempo, and the plug-in fits perfectly into your production environment with a freely resizable, high-definition UI and support for VST3, AAX, and AU formats.\n\nVintage synths like the JUPITER-8 had internal trim controls that allowed technicians to tweak various analog components when they drifted out of spec. But sometimes, “out of spec” created a sound that was unique, interesting, or extraordinary. Realized through our latest ACB advancements, the newly added Circuit Mod function lets you sweep through multiple trims using a single macro control. Along with the Condition parameter, which simulates the effects of aging, you can dial in everything from a factory-primed JUPITER-8 to a road-worn synth that hasn’t seen a tech bench in decades.\n\nThe sophisticated browser lets you explore the JUPITER-8’s stunning collection of factory presets, your own custom sounds, and patches downloaded from Roland Cloud. Search across all installed patch banks, sort results, rate your favorites, jot down notes, and make quick adjustments with the integrated tweak panel.\n\nThe JUPITER-8 Software Synthesizer offers full integration with the SYSTEM-8 keyboard. You can change the JUPITER-8’s plug-in panel to match the SYSTEM-8 for intuitive, one-to-one control. Or use the PLUG-OUT functionality to turn your SYSTEM-8 into a standalone JUPITER-8 that you can play in the studio or on stage.\n\nThe JUPITER-8 Software Synthesizer is available with Roland Cloud Pro (via Pro Selector) and Ultimate memberships or a Lifetime Key purchase. Roland Cloud is also home to software versions of other vintage Roland instruments plus ZENOLOGY, ZENOLOGY FX, Zenbeats, and other inspiring music tools to back your creative journeys.\n\nJoin Roland Cloud\n\nTry the JUPITER-8 Software Synthesizer for free with a Roland Cloud 30-day trial membership.\n\nAn intimate quest for connection, the latest release from TEED is a shimmering, memory-soaked blend of tender synths and emotional clarity.Read more…\n\nHere's how the 1984 Queen single flipped the script on their musical direction, ushering in a new wave of success for the group.Read more…\n\nDesign sounds using iconic Roland synths that share the same language: the JUNO-60, JUNO-106, JUPITER-8, JUPITER-4, PROMARS, and SH-101.Read more…\n\nOn the eve of the Silver Panda remix of \"Lift Me Up,\" Moby discusses his philosophies on sharing music, collaboration, and much more.Read more…\n\nLearn how to take your soft synths into uncharted territory by pairing them with the Roland Cloud BOSS Effects Pedals plug-in.Read more…\n\nThe prolific UK producer discusses Roland gear, mysterious vinyl releases, and collaborating with Thom Yorke and Jonathan Zawada.Read more…\n\nThe Birmingham-based virtuoso discusses his jazz roots, touring with Sam Smith, scoring for the screen, and the key to a successful music career.Read more…\n\nLearn the origin story of vocal harmonizers and processors and explore the science behind creating vocal harmonies with music technology.Read more…\n\nAll you need is a DAW and Roland Cloud to record a polished demo.

      "description": "A true desert island synth, the SYSTEM-1 fuses classic and utterly modern synth tones. Spend a little time with its intuitive controls and quickly generate inspiring sounds that sit perfectly in your mixes—thumping basses, glistening arps, warm pads, plucked synths, lo-fi effects, and more.\n\nThe Scatter capability of the SYSTEM-1’s arpeggiator fuels experimentation and happy accidents. Six arpeggio types with six step settings combine with variable Scatter types and depth to create an infinite selection of patterns. In addition to notes, arpeggiate synth parameters like cutoff and resonance to build moving sequences and animated textures.\n\nThe SYSTEM-1 Software Synthesizer is a must-have for SYSTEM-1 or SYSTEM-1m hardware owners. Seamless, bi-directional communication between hardware and software gives complete editor/librarian functionality and an automatic, one-to-one hardware control interface.\n\nJoin today for full access to the future classic SYSTEM-1, along with the vintage instruments that inspired it.\n\nAdd presence, bite, and spatial width to synth basses, leads, pads, and more with the JC-120 Jazz Chorus guitar amplifier software effect.Read more…\n\nThe normally secretive artist took time to discuss the process behind creating their new GALAXIAS Scene Packs.Read more…\n\nThe SH-2 is an early synth classic. Discover how to master this rarity via its authentic recreation in Roland Cloud.Read more…\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "The SYSTEM-8 draws on our deep history of synthesizer research and development, with circuit-accurate models of classic Roland oscillators, filters, and effects. It includes legendary third-party oscillator types as well, plus the famous JUPITER and JUNO filter designs for super-authentic vintage sounds.\n\nThe SYSTEM-8 does modern sounds too, with many flavors of digital and analog-style oscillators, plus waveshapes like SuperSaw, FM and more. In addition to classic filter models, options include an all-new VCF along with more recent designs like the unique formant, harmonic, and side-band filters. This makes the SYSTEM-8 unparalleled in its versatility, going from glass to growl—or pluck to punch—with just a few tweaks of its controls.\n\nFor synthesizer power users, combining the Roland SYSTEM-8 software synthesizer with its hardware sibling is a potent pairing. Sound designers will love the ability to play and shape sounds with a velocity-sensitive keyboard and dedicated controls. Live performers will appreciate transferring patches to hardware and taking the stage computer-free.\n\nJoin Roland Cloud today for full access to the powerful SYSTEM-8 and the vintage instruments that inspired it.\n\nThe normally secretive artist took time to discuss the process behind creating their new GALAXIAS Scene Packs.Read more…\n\nThe legendary songwriter and performer discusses Roland synthesizers, positive thinking, and music’s power to transform.Read more…\n\nThe prolific player shares her thoughts on touring with RAYE, finding success in the music industry, and her Roland gear.Read more…\n\nThe SH-2 is an early synth classic. Discover how to master this rarity via its authentic recreation in Roland Cloud.Read more…\n\nSince its debut, the SYSTEM-8 has become a mainstay. From big room to dubstep to techno, its powerful synthesis engine covers all the bases.Read more…\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "303 DAY: DJ Pierre and the Roland TB-303\n\nSome instruments are so groundbreaking they create entire musical genres. The TB-303 is one of these influential instruments, but it wasn’t always seen that way. When Roland released the TB-303 in 1981, it was marketed as a computerized bass machine to simulate a traditional bass guitar, but didn’t quite catch on. Later on, inventive electronic musicians discovered the 303, often on the secondhand market, and found new uses for its recognizably fluid low end.\n\nUsing the 303 in new ways, DJ Pierre and Phuture pioneered what came to be known as acid. This new sound ignited other electronic music genres and, like the Roland TR-808’s influence on hip-hop, the TB-303 played an essential role in late ‘80s-early ‘90s rave culture. While we may never really understand why the 303 sound makes people want to dance, there’s no denying its power, influence, and unwavering ability to get a party started.\n\nThe TB-303 Software Synthesizer takes the classic instrument to the next level. Utilizing Analog Circuit Behavior modeling the virtual TB-303 captures the hypnotic tone of the original hardware and forms the perfect complement to the TR-909 and other classic Roland instruments. The iconic interface and signature crunch and squelch of the original are perfectly reproduced, while adding new features which surely would have turned heads back in the day:\n\nThe 303’s new editing window is one of the most striking features. For the first time, you can create and edit patterns with a visual interface. With the ability to see the DNA of a preset pattern, you can edit a variation, or start from scratch then step-edit a new pattern, using up to six octaves with user-defined scales, accents, slides, pitch manipulation, and more. The new randomize/generate functions create an endless supply of classic 303 patterns.\n\nWith five new play modes (Forward/Reverse/FWD&REV/Invert/Random) the TB-303 Software Synthesizer widens the ability to experiment. These new functions allow sonic alchemists to twist and turn the bass, changing direction at will.\n\nFor the first time, the TB-303 can hold up to 64 patterns and 64 patches per bank. The eight variations of a pattern are still accessible on the UI faceplate. Plus, with 32 preset patterns and 48 unique sounds, the 303 arrives complete with sonic templates for you to explore.\n\nA hidden panel on the far-right corner of the 303 unlocks a variety of new tone-coloring features. Explore the expanded circuit modification via the new VCF trim, Vintage Condition, and Master Tune knobs. The onboard effects, including distortion and delay with tempo-sync, are sure to inspire fresh ideas.\n\nRoland Cloud’s TB-303 provides the means to emulate the past or lay down brave new pathways. It’s an instrument with a proud history of shaking up the status quo and defying expectations. Use the TB-303 to leave an imprint on tomorrow’s sounds and become part of a lasting musical legacy.\n\nPairing with the TB-03 Roland Boutique synth or the TB-3 Touch Bassline provides hands-on control for the plug-in.\n\nThe legendary sonic architect shares exclusive insights about the technology and techniques behind some of his landmark productions.Read more…\n\nOn the eve of the Silver Panda remix of \"Lift Me Up,\" Moby discusses his philosophies on sharing music, collaboration, and much more.Read more…\n\nFrom genre-blending origins to raw, emotional techno, Death in Vegas charts Richard Fearless' singular sonic journey through a vintage lens.Read more…\n\nLearn how to take your soft synths into uncharted territory by pairing them with the Roland Cloud BOSS Effects Pedals plug-in.Read more…\n\nThe Human League and Heaven 17 founder Martyn Ware steps back in time to discuss a career spent at the intersection of music and technology.Read more…\n\nThe prolific UK producer discusses Roland gear, mysterious vinyl releases, and collaborating with Thom Yorke and Jonathan Zawada.Read more…\n\nOriginal SP-404 designer Kenji Yamada and current project leader Takeo Shirato discuss the 404 concept, its widespread popularity, and more.Read more…\n\nPeer inside this idiosyncratic fest with four unique acts from spring 2025 who discuss their artistry and what makes CRSSD so special.Read more…\n\nIf you want your sequences to hit harder and groove deeper this guide will show you how to program, tweak, and automate the 303 like a pro.Read more…\n\nBreak down the techniques to create 303-based sounds, complete with step-by-step programming tips and real-world track references.Read more…\n\nHere's how the artist's omnipresent '90s hit \"Praise You\" harnessed the Roland TB-303 to become a radio and dancefloor sensation.Read more…\n\nLeftfield came from the same primordial soup as the greatest British dance acts.

      "description": "Schmitt Kit\nDamien processed this kit exactly how he processes his acoustic kit in the studio. The kick and snare are internal sounds layered with custom samples of his acoustic drums, and the toms offer tight and precise attack characteristics. The ride has just enough muffling to ensure it doesn't talk too much, providing the balance required for traditional swing or driving the cymbal in a jazz fusion style.\n\nTimba\nTo play Latin music like salsa and songo, you need timbales, claves, and a cowbell. Damien is an experienced Latin music player, and he’s conceived a kit that offers a vibrant Latin percussion setup within a standard drum layout, powered by his custom samples. The hi-hat has a claves sound that’s triggered when you close the pedal firmly with the foot. The second tom has a low timbales sound on the head and a high timbales sound on the rim, while the ride is now your cowbell.\n\nP Funk Kit\nIf you like the funky deadened drum sound from the 1970s, the authentic voice of this kit will instantly transport you back to that era. The kick has a low-mid tuning, the snare has a fat tone with heavy muffling, and the toms are processed the same way as the snare. Enjoy the nostalgic vibe and lose yourself in fat, retro grooves!\n\nTD-17 Artist Kits enhance your TD-17 module with the sounds, settings, and experience of top professional drummers. They’re available exclusively through Roland Cloud, the home of an expanding collection of premium V-Drums kits, curated samples, and jam tracks to inspire your music.

The module’s powerful ambience tools place this kit in a spacious live showcase club with a 200-seat capacity.\n\nBreaks\nThis hip-hop kit offers a processed sound reminiscent of the drums in “Ch-Check It Out” by the Beastie Boys, an influential party dance tune from the mid-2000s.\n\n’80s Vibes\nInspired by the punchy and polished sound of the drums on Smokey Robinson's “Just to See Her,” this kit is perfect for ’80s pop and R&B styles.\n\nNote: The kits in this collection have been created using the internal TD-17 instruments and editing tools combined with newly developed samples to reinforce certain drum sounds.

      "description": "Dance 2 It\nThis kit emulates the drum sound of “Dance to the Music” by Sly and the Family Stone, a classic track from 1968 that highlights Greg Errico's tight and energetic drumming style.\n\nEmpty Window\nThis kit reproduces the drum sound of Erykah Badu's “Window Seat” from 2010. The song features a spacious groove with a distinctive bright snare sound. The kit also includes clap sounds for the song’s bridge sections.\n\nIt’s Gonna Be\nModeled on the intimate drum sounds from “Lovely Day,” as played by Russ Kunkel on the 1977 album Menagerie by singer/songwriter Bill Withers.\n\nVirtual Jamz\nReproduces the drum sound from “Virtual Insanity,” a hit dance track from 1996 by the British band Jamiroquai that was inspired by a winter walk through an underground city space in Japan. The punchy drums lock nicely with the fat bass groove and funky keyboard sounds.\n\nLocked Out\nModeled on the organic drum sounds from “Locked Out of Heaven,” a chart-topping track from the 2012 Unorthodox Jukebox album by singer/songwriter Bruno Mars.\n\nNote: The kits in this collection have been created using the internal TD-17 instruments and editing tools combined with newly developed samples to reinforce certain drum sounds. Because the original recordings are not used within this collection, these kits should be considered as taking inspiration from the original sounds rather than being exact replicas.\n\nThe owners of the songs referenced above are not affiliated or licensed with Roland. Company names and product names referenced are registered trademarks and/or trademarks of their respective owners.\n\nV-Drums Kit Packs are premium drum kits for select V-Drums modules, crafted by leading drummers and audio engineers to deliver polished, professional drum sounds for live performance, recording, and practice. Each ready-to-play kit makes full use of the module’s powerful drum editing tools and studio-grade processing for an instantly satisfying playing experience. Custom samples layered with internal drums are also included, providing unique sounds you can’t get anywhere else.\n\nV-Drums Kit Packs are available exclusively through Roland Cloud, the home of an expanding collection of V-Drums content, classic Roland instruments, curated samples, music production tools, and jam tracks to inspire your creative journeys.\n\nDownload TD-17 Kit Pack: Greatest Funk/R&B Tracks Vol. 2 today—available with a Lifetime Key purchase in Roland Cloud Manager.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "Texas Metal\nModeled on “Cowboys from Hell” by Pantera, as played by Vinnie Paul on the band’s major label debut of the same name from 1990.\n\nTearHimDown\nBased on “Kill the King” from Rainbow’s 1978 album Long Live Rock ’n’ Roll, the influential band led by original Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore. Cozy Powell's speedy and powerful drumming drives this track.\n\nAce It\nRecreates the drum sound on Motorhead’s “Ace of Spades,” the title track from the band’s 1980 album release. This song features fast, tight drumming by Phil “Philthy Animal” Taylor.\n\nHallowedBeat\nModels the heavy drum sound from “Sole Survivor” by the long-running German power metal band Helloween. This track was on the 1994 album Master of the Rings and features monster drumming from Uli Kusch.\n\nForAllMySins\nThe drum sound from “Punishment” on Biohazard's 1992 album Urban Discipline. This intense, multi-tempo track combines hardcore punk, heavy metal, and hip-hop elements.\n\nNote: The kits in this collection have been created using the internal TD-17 instruments and editing tools combined with newly developed samples to reinforce certain drum sounds. Because the original recordings are not used within this collection, these kits should be considered as taking inspiration from the original sounds rather than being exact replicas.\n\nThe owners of the songs referenced above are not affiliated or licensed with Roland. Company names and product names referenced are registered trademarks and/or trademarks of their respective owners.\n\nV-Drums Kit Packs are premium drum kits for select V-Drums modules, crafted by leading drummers and audio engineers to deliver polished, professional drum sounds for live performance, recording, and practice. Each ready-to-play kit makes full use of the module’s powerful drum editing tools and studio-grade processing for an instantly satisfying playing experience. Custom samples layered with internal drums are also included, providing unique sounds you can’t get anywhere else.\n\nV-Drums Kit Packs are available exclusively through Roland Cloud, the home of an expanding collection of V-Drums content, classic Roland instruments, curated samples, music production tools, and jam tracks to inspire your creative journeys.\n\nDownload TD-17 Kit Pack: Greatest Metal Vol. 2 today—available with a Lifetime Key purchase in Roland Cloud Manager.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "The free Roland Cloud Version 2 update for TD-17 drum kits adds an array of new features and enhancements to the module.\n\nTD-17 Version 2 adds 20 new premium-quality preset kits, bringing the onboard total to 70. Experience the warm vibes of “Acoustic,” or play on a small stage with the tight “Shallow Mini” kit. Rock heavy in the wide-open expanse of “Arena Stage,” or go for maximum recording clarity with the clean and defined “BigWoodShell” kit. And that’s just a start—whatever music drives your passion, the TD-17 will help you get there.\n\nYou’re not just limited to the preset kits inside the TD-17 module. Explore an ever-growing range of content on Roland Cloud, including artist kits from pro drummers like Anika Nilles, Craig Blundell, Kaz Rodriguez, and more. Once you have a free Roland Cloud account, download what appeals to you and dig in.\n\nAll the internal instruments in the TD-17 can be further enhanced by loading and layering user samples. The TD-17 Version 2 update automatically loads 26 professional quality samples, which are used in the 20 new preset kits. The samples can also be freely assigned to other preset and custom kits to develop new tones and timbres.\n\nWhen drums are professionally recorded, reverbs and compressors are often added in the mixing phase to enhance individual drums or the entire kit. TD-17 Version 2 adds these powerful processing tools, allowing you to bring studio polish to kits and create drum sounds as individual as you are.\n\nThe TD-17’s Multi FX section is another excellent way to change up your sound and bring fresh inspiration to your playing. Eleven new types have been added to the module’s already impressive arsenal, including Equalizer, Spectrum, Low Boost, Enhancer, Humanizer, Slicer, Step Flanger, Hexa-Chorus, 4Tap Pan Delay, Enhancer→Flanger, and Speaker Simulator.\n\nTD-17 Version 2 also includes trigger parameter settings for the latest V-Pads and V-Cymbals, including the thin-profile CY-12C-T crash and CY-14R-T ride.\n\nDownload TD-17 Version 2 today—available for free with a Roland Account and Roland Cloud Manager.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

Inspired by concrete drum rooms with tall ceilings, the immersive reverberation has an atmospheric feel that’s almost trip-hop in style.\n\nStudioverb\nInspired by a Japanese recording studio known for its unique reverberation, this kit captures the natural, open sound of a large space.\n\nConcert Tour (Birch Rock Drums)\nImagine classic birch drums, an alternative rock band, and a concert venue with a crowd of several thousand people—that’s exactly the spirit this kit is designed to capture.\n\nHome Studio (Tight 80s Birch)\nThe drums on some of the greatest albums have been recorded in the most modest studio environments. This kit captures the sound of a German ’80s birch drum set within a tight and confined home space.\n\nStudio Snare (High Roof Mic)\nA recording studio located in the Nakano ward is synonymous with Tokyo’s rock, alternative, and metal scene.

      "description": "Vintage 24”\nWith its open 24” kick drum and ’60s-era U.S. snare, this retro kit has the perfect vibe for old-school rock, pop, and blues.\n\nSoul Skool\nIdeal for classic soul tracks, this kit uses the module’s onboard processing tools to create a tight, percussive sound with vintage-style studio compression and tape drive.\n\nStudioFusion\nThis kit delivers a lively studio drum sound heard on many contemporary tracks. The crisp and articulate character of the hard maple shells is great for clean, modern grooves and detailed phrasing.\n\nBreaks\nThis hip-hop kit offers a processed sound reminiscent of the drums in “Ch-Check It Out” by the Beastie Boys, an influential party dance tune from the mid-2000s.\n\n’80s Vibes\nInspired by the punchy and polished sound of the drums on Smokey Robinson's “Just to See Her,” this kit is perfect for ’80s pop and R&B styles.\n\nNote: The kits in this collection have been created using the internal TD-27 instruments and editing tools combined with newly developed samples to reinforce certain drum sounds. Because the original recordings are not used within this collection, these kits should be considered as taking inspiration from the original sounds rather than being exact replicas.\n\nThe owners of the songs referenced above are not affiliated or licensed with Roland. Company names and product names referenced are registered trademarks and/or trademarks of their respective owners.\n\nV-Drums Kit Packs are premium drum kits for select V-Drums modules, crafted by leading drummers and audio engineers to deliver polished, professional drum sounds for live performance, recording, and practice. Each ready-to-play kit makes full use of the module’s powerful drum editing tools and studio-grade processing for an instantly satisfying playing experience.

      "description": "Play with the sounds behind the most influential groove-driven music from the ’70s, ’80s, and ’90s with TD-27 Kit Pack: Greatest Funk/R&B Tracks Vol. 1, a premium collection of drum kits and custom layered samples for the TD-27 V-Drums sound module.\n\nMellow Out\nModeled on Questlove’s drum sound from the 1995 hip-hop album Do You Want More?!!!??! by The Roots. This kit is designed for playing along with the track “Mellow My Man.”\n\nLunar Piper\nIconic songwriter, producer, and performer Prince was backed by drummer Bobby Z. on the album Purple Rain from 1984. The powerful hybrid sound of the title track—recorded live on stage with a combination of electronic and acoustic drums—is faithfully recreated with this kit.\n\nIt’s Alright\nEarth, Wind & Fire are masters of upbeat funk grooves. This kit is tuned for jamming with the track “Let’s Groove” from the band’s 1981 album Raise!\n\nGodfather\nChannel your inner “Funky Drummer” and lay it down with the kit sounds from James Brown’s classic 1970 soul track, played by the legendary Clyde Stubblefield.\n\nBlack Cats!\nAs drum intros go, there’s perhaps none more recognizable than Stevie Wonder’s “Superstition.” This kit perfectly captures the drum sound from the track, played by the artist himself on the 1972 album Talking Book.\n\nNote: The kits in this collection have been created using the internal TD-27 instruments and editing tools combined with newly developed samples to reinforce certain drum sounds. Because the original recordings are not used within this collection, these kits should be considered as taking inspiration from the original sounds rather than being exact replicas.\n\nThe owners of the songs referenced above are not affiliated or licensed with Roland. Company names and product names referenced are registered trademarks and/or trademarks of their respective owners.\n\nV-Drums Kit Packs are premium drum kits for select V-Drums modules, crafted by leading drummers and audio engineers to deliver polished, professional drum sounds for live performance, recording, and practice. Each ready-to-play kit makes full use of the module’s powerful drum editing tools and studio-grade processing for an instantly satisfying playing experience. Custom samples layered with internal drums are also included, providing unique sounds you can’t get anywhere else.\n\nV-Drums Kit Packs are available exclusively through Roland Cloud, the home of an expanding collection of V-Drums content, classic Roland instruments, curated samples, music production tools, and jam tracks to inspire your creative journeys.\n\nDownload TD-27 Kit Pack: Greatest Funk/R&B Tracks Vol. 1 today—available with a Lifetime Key purchase in Roland Cloud Manager.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "Dance 2 It\nThis kit emulates the drum sound of “Dance to the Music” by Sly and the Family Stone, a classic track from 1968 that highlights Greg Errico's tight and energetic drumming style.\n\nEmpty Window\nThis kit reproduces the drum sound of Erykah Badu's “Window Seat” from 2010. The song features a spacious groove with a distinctive bright snare sound. The kit also includes clap sounds for the song’s bridge sections.\n\nIt’s Gonna Be\nModeled on the intimate drum sounds from “Lovely Day,” as played by Russ Kunkel on the 1977 album Menagerie by singer/songwriter Bill Withers.\n\nVirtual Jamz\nReproduces the drum sound from “Virtual Insanity,” a hit dance track from 1996 by the British band Jamiroquai that was inspired by a winter walk through an underground city space in Japan. The punchy drums lock nicely with the fat bass groove and funky keyboard sounds.\n\nLocked Out\nModeled on the organic drum sounds from “Locked Out of Heaven,” a chart-topping track from the 2012 Unorthodox Jukebox album by singer/songwriter Bruno Mars.\n\nNote: The kits in this collection have been created using the internal TD-27 instruments and editing tools combined with newly developed samples to reinforce certain drum sounds.

      "description": "Jam along with Greatest Metal Vol. 1, a hard-hitting collection of drum kits and custom layered samples for the TD-27 V-Drums sound module.\n\nOne Eye Open\nModeled on the track “Enter Sandman” by Metallica, as played by Lars Ulrich on the band’s eponymous fifth album (also known as The Black Album).\n\nMyDOOM!\nPractice Tomas Haake’s insane kick patterns day and night with this kit inspired by “Bleed” from the album obZen by Meshuggah.\n\nChow Mein!\nThis kit recreates the sound of the drums on System of a Down’s “Chop Suey” from the album Toxicity, as played by John Dolmayan.\n\nR.T.T.H (Run 4 Your Life)\nAs classic metal songs go, “Run to The Hills” by Iron Maiden is up there with the best. Originally played by the late Clive Burr on The Number of the Beast—and performed live since 1982 by the charismatic Nicko McBrain—this kit will have you working on fast sixteenths for hours.\n\nDu Musst (es spielen)\nTranslated as “you have to play it,” this kit recreates the sound of “Du Hast” by Rammstein, as played by Christoph Schneider on the band’s seminal metal album Sehnsucht.\n\nNote: The kits in this collection have been created using the internal TD-27 instruments and editing tools combined with newly developed samples to reinforce certain drum sounds. Because the original recordings are not used within this collection, these kits should be considered as taking inspiration from the original sounds rather than being exact replicas.\n\nThe owners of the songs referenced above are not affiliated or licensed with Roland. Company names and product names referenced are registered trademarks and/or trademarks of their respective owners.\n\nV-Drums Kit Packs are premium drum kits for select V-Drums modules, crafted by leading drummers and audio engineers to deliver polished, professional drum sounds for live performance, recording, and practice. Each ready-to-play kit makes full use of the module’s powerful drum editing tools and studio-grade processing for an instantly satisfying playing experience. Custom samples layered with internal drums are also included, providing unique sounds you can’t get anywhere else.\n\nV-Drums Kit Packs are available exclusively through Roland Cloud, the home of an expanding collection of V-Drums content, classic Roland instruments, curated samples, music production tools, and jam tracks to inspire your creative journeys.\n\nDownload TD-27 Kit Pack: Greatest Metal Tracks Vol. 1 today—available with a Lifetime Key purchase in Roland Cloud Manager.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

This kit is designed for playing along with the track “Smells Like Teen Spirit.”\n\nWalkedHisWay\nRecreates the sound of Joey Kramer’s drums from the classic Aerosmith track “Walk This Way.”\n\nK.I.T.N.O.\nThe drum sound of Brad Wilk of Rage Against the Machine is captured in this kit, perfect for playing along with “Killing in the Name” from the band’s eponymous debut album.\n\nBurning ’74\nThe driving sound of mid-’70s hard rock in the form of Ian Paice’s drum set, made to accompany the track “Burn” from the Deep Purple album of the same name.\n\nJumping\nClassic ’80s pop-metal drums, designed to sound like Alex Van Halen’s kit on “Jump” from the 1984 album by Van Halen.\n\nNote: The kits in this collection have been created using the internal TD-27 instruments and editing tools combined with newly developed samples to reinforce certain drum sounds. Because the original recordings are not used within this collection, these kits should be considered as taking inspiration from the original sounds rather than being exact replicas.\n\nThe owners of the songs referenced above are not affiliated or licensed with Roland.

      "description": "CrackinUp\nModeled on Tré Cool’s high-intensity drum sound from “Basket Case” on Dookie, Green Day’s major-label debut from 1994.\n\nStillSeeking\nGroove along with the majestic drum sound from U2’s “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For,” as played by Larry Mullen Jr. on the band’s iconic album The Joshua Tree from 1987.\n\nGolden Rise\nJam with the resonant drums from “Sunshine of Your Love,” one of the foundational hard rock songs from the 1960s. Filled with inventive tom-driven playing by Ginger Baker, this track is on Cream’s Disraeli Gears album from 1967.\n\nSOSBeat\nThis kit is based on “Message in a Bottle” by The Police, which appears on the band’s 1979 album Reggatta de Blanc. Played by Stewart Copeland, this drumming masterpiece features reggae-inspired grooves, deft hi-hat phrasing, and a distinctive high-pitched snare.\n\nSaveUrslf\nThis heavy kit captures Brad Wilk’s driving drum sound from “Cochise” on Audioslave's self-titled 2002 debut. This supergroup featured members from Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine.\n\nNote: The kits in this collection have been created using the internal TD-27 instruments and editing tools combined with newly developed samples to reinforce certain drum sounds. Because the original recordings are not used within this collection, these kits should be considered as taking inspiration from the original sounds rather than being exact replicas.\n\nThe owners of the songs referenced above are not affiliated or licensed with Roland.
