      "description": "Meet Aerophone Brisa, an exciting evolution of the growing Roland Aerophone platform. This elegant instrument combines the design and key layout of a traditional flute with the modern benefits of the Aerophone series, including a diverse selection of onboard sounds and deep customization options. Aerophone Brisa also features a newly developed sound engine tailored for different wind instrument styles, with a special focus on the unique articulations and techniques used by flute players.\n\nDiscover the Roland Aerophone Brisa, a revolutionary digital wind instrument designed with flute players in mind. In this in-depth video, flutist Elena Pinderhughes guides you through everything you need to know about Brisa, from expressive sound demos to intuitive design features that adapt to your unique playing style.\n\nIn this exclusive performance, visionary saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings brings Brisa to life, blending his spiritual jazz roots with futuristic textures and tones. His dynamic improvisation showcases the expressive depth and versatility of Brisa, proving that tradition and innovation can coexist in perfect harmony.\n\nWatch acclaimed flutist and composer Elena Pinderhughes bring the Aerophone Brisa to life in this expressive sound demo performance. From acoustic emulations to bold synth textures, Elena showcases Brisa\u2019s wide sonic palette with artistry and flair.\n\nCreating with Aerophone Brisa is a comfortable and friendly experience for flutists, players of other wind instruments, and beginners alike. The stylish, lightweight design offers a straight structure, responsive flute-style keys, and intuitive controls, making playing effortless and enjoyable.\n\nAerophone Brisa features SuperNATURAL Winds, a new Aerophone sound engine that leverages our latest advancements in natural wind expression. Delivering rich, inspiring tones, it faithfully translates every breath nuance into vibrant sound, mirroring the immediate response and dynamic control of acoustic instruments.\n\nWith 100 onboard tones, Aerophone Brisa is ready to fuel limitless creative journeys.

In contrast with a traditional flute, sound is produced by blowing directly into the mouthpiece, simplifying the playing experience. By adjusting the head joint, it\u2019s easy to dial in the most comfortable playing angle. You can also execute flute octave switching techniques by directing your breath between the two mouthpiece holes as you play.\n\nAerophone Brisa offers multiple fingering options to meet the needs of a wide range of players.

There\u2019s also a transposition function that lets you play any musical piece with your most comfortable fingering.\n\nThere are numerous ways to control Aerophone Brisa sounds in real time, unlocking all-new performance approaches. Use the thumb and S1/S2 buttons to enhance tones with harmonies and unique expressive colors. And with the instrument\u2019s integrated motion sensor, you can apply vibrato, pitch bend, and other effects with simple body movements.\n\nAerophone Brisa flows everywhere your creative life takes you. With the onboard speaker, headphone jack, and rechargeable battery, you can play anytime and anywhere. The USB-C port provides audio/MIDI communication with music production apps, and the headphone output can also be used to connect with a sound system for live performances. In addition, Bluetooth MIDI is available to send wireless MIDI data to Bluetooth-enabled devices and expand your control options with the BOSS FS-1-WL and EV-1-WL.\n\nThis powerful companion app extends the Aerophone Brisa experience with your smartphone or tablet. Adjust internal parameters from your device\u2019s touchscreen, save and recall favorite sounds, and use the fingering display to study layouts and view notes as you play them. You also get integrated access to many additional sounds on Roland Cloud to expand your creative range.\n\nAerophone Brisa Plus\n\nIn this in-depth video, flutist Elena Pinderhughes guides you through everything you need to know about Brisa, from expressive sound demos to intuitive design features that adapt to your unique playing style.\n\nThe Aerophone Brisa Engineering team discusses the power and potential of the latest addition to the family of instruments.Read more\u2026\n\nLearn how the Aerophone series offers wind players a versatile and expressive way to explore new sounds and performance styles while staying true to familiar techniques.Read more\u2026\n\nCompanion app for Aerophone Brisa.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner\u2019s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "Customize the Blues Cube amps with Robben Ford\u2019s signature blues and fusion tones.\n\nGuitarist Gary Cook explores the Roland Blues Cube amps, demoing the flexible tonal range from the Stock Sound all the way through each of Roland\u2019s unique Tone Capsules.\n\nRobben Ford is a guitarist\u2019s guitarist, well known for his dynamic, expressive style and equally expressive tones. For many years, he\u2019s used a prized, custom-made tube amplifier to achieve his bold clean sound and responsive, bluesy lead voice. \u201cSound is absolutely number one,\u201d Robben says. \u201cWithout a good sound, it's very difficult to take the first step forward. So it's completely essential in everything that I do.\u201d\n\nRoland initially presented the Tone Capsule concept to Robben during a visit to his home. After playing through the Blues Cube amps and discussing the possibilities, he was very excited to move forward with the project. At that initial meeting, the engineers paid close attention to Robben\u2019s playing techniques and his thoughts about the ideal sound and response characteristics for a guitar amp. They developed a prototype Tone Capsule based on that input, and arranged a second meeting at a soundstage in Los Angeles for more discussion and refinement.\n\nThe final tuning took place while Robben was touring on the East Coast of the United States. Using his vintage 1960 Telecaster and Les Paul, Robben played the Blues Cube amps at concert volumes, working directly with the engineers to further refine the Tone Capsule voicing to his exacting tastes. Particular attention was paid to the attack characteristics and overall tonal balance, and to ensure that the clean channel responded to overdrive pedals exactly as he prefers.\n\nAfter the tour was over, the team met again in Los Angeles for an audition of the final Tone Capsule, and Robben was quite pleased. \u201cI am satisfied with the result,\u201d he said. \u201cThe clarity is kind of the salient issue for me in any case. I like to hear just a straight sound, a very true sound, and this is incredibly close to how I want to hear the guitar.\n\n\u201cWe got it, I think, as far as we could possibly get at this point,\u201d Robben continues. \u201cI don't know what else we could do. The one element that is unique here is that it's solid-state technology, and I've been playing through tube amplifiers all my life. So how close we got to that sound, you know, to me is quite phenomenal. It is incredibly close to vacuum tube technology, and that's how most people hear the guitar and think of the guitar. To think that Roland has come up with something that is as convincing as this is pretty impressive.\u201d\n\nThe Robben Ford Blues Cube Tone Capsule works with the Blues Cube Artist, Blues Cube Artist212, Blues Cube Stage, and Blues Cube Tour amplifiers. Robben\u2019s favored Blues Cube amp is the Artist212 model, which he prefers for its 2x12\u201d speaker combination and punchy, high-headroom output of 85 watts.\n\nDriven by Roland\u2019s innovative Tube Logic design, the Blues Cube amplifier series captures the musical sound and inspiring feel of classic tube guitar amps with complete authenticity. One of the many benefits of Tube Logic is the ability to instantly change the amplifier\u2019s voicing via a Tone Capsule socket on the chassis. Developed in direct collaboration with the world\u2019s finest guitarists, the growing lineup of Tone Capsules allow you to easily customize your Blues Cube with the tone and touch preferences of these master players.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner\u2019s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "Transparent Clean Tones with Ultra-Expressive Response. Jeff \u201cSkunk\u201d Baxter Kindly explains about concept of Sparkle Clean Tone Capsule.\n\nWhile the stock Blues Cube tone is firmly rooted in American Tweed territory, the Sparkle Clean Tone Capsule reshapes the amp with a voice inspired by the expressive clean tones of early KT66-driven British amps. The tonal range is wider from low to high, with big, dynamic headroom that lets the unique sounds of different guitars and pedals shine through. The sound is also thick, organic, and ultra-responsive at every setting, thanks to the meticulous Tube Logic approach and detailed fine tuning of the output transformer, speaker impedance, negative feedback, and other interactive elements.\n\nIn contrast to the stock Blues Cube and other available Tone Capsules, the Sparkle Clean Tone Capsule takes a slightly different voicing approach with the amp\u2019s two channels. The Clean channel offers a solid clean tone as you\u2019d expect. But instead of kicking in a higher-gain sound, the Crunch channel builds on the core clean foundation to deliver a unique character with added richness and extra harmonics. These two dynamic voices provide great variety for clean-based players, and also offer wide-ranging versatility for shaping tones with stompbox effects.\n\nWith the Sparkle Clean Tone Capsule, the amp\u2019s tone stack has been customized to complement the two different channel voicings. Setting the tone knobs at noon provides a great starting point for many clean styles, from contemporary jazz solos to punchy country picking. Cutting back the midrange opens up a more full-range sound that\u2019s perfect for shimmering chord work and steel guitar playing. The amp\u2019s reverb has been tweaked as well, with a longer pre-delay time that works in perfect harmony with the Tone Capsule\u2019s quick transient response.\n\nDriven by Roland\u2019s innovative Tube Logic design, the Blues Cube amplifier series captures the musical sound and inspiring feel of classic tube guitar amps with complete authenticity. One of the many benefits of Tube Logic is the ability to instantly change the amplifier\u2019s voicing via a Tone Capsule socket on the chassis. Developed in direct collaboration with the world\u2019s finest guitarists, the growing lineup of Tone Capsules allow you to easily customize your Blues Cube with the tone and touch preferences of these master players.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner\u2019s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

        "The Ultimate Transparent Tube Voice\n\nWhile the stock Blues Cube tone is firmly rooted in American Tweed territory, the Sparkle Clean Tone Capsule reshapes the amp with a voice inspired by the expressive clean tones of early KT66-driven British amps. The tonal range is wider from low to high, with big, dynamic headroom that lets the unique sounds of different guitars and pedals shine through. The sound is also thick, organic, and ultra-responsive at every setting, thanks to the meticulous Tube Logic approach and detailed fine tuning of the output transformer, speaker impedance, negative feedback, and other interactive elements.",
        "Two Versatile Channels\n\nIn contrast to the stock Blues Cube and other available Tone Capsules, the Sparkle Clean Tone Capsule takes a slightly different voicing approach with the amp\u2019s two channels. The Clean channel offers a solid clean tone as you\u2019d expect. But instead of kicking in a higher-gain sound, the Crunch channel builds on the core clean foundation to deliver a unique character with added richness and extra harmonics. These two dynamic voices provide great variety for clean-based players, and also offer wide-ranging versatility for shaping tones with stompbox effects.",
        "Re-Voiced Tone Stack and Reverb\n\nWith the Sparkle Clean Tone Capsule, the amp\u2019s tone stack has been customized to complement the two different channel voicings. Setting the tone knobs at noon provides a great starting point for many clean styles, from contemporary jazz solos to punchy country picking. Cutting back the midrange opens up a more full-range sound that\u2019s perfect for shimmering chord work and steel guitar playing. The amp\u2019s reverb has been tweaked as well, with a longer pre-delay time that works in perfect harmony with the Tone Capsule\u2019s quick transient response.",
        "Tone Capsule Expansion: Instantly Customize the Sound of Your Blues Cube Amp\n\nDriven by Roland\u2019s innovative Tube Logic design, the Blues Cube amplifier series captures the musical sound and inspiring feel of classic tube guitar amps with complete authenticity. One of the many benefits of Tube Logic is the ability to instantly change the amplifier\u2019s voicing via a Tone Capsule socket on the chassis. Developed in direct collaboration with the world\u2019s finest guitarists, the growing lineup of Tone Capsules allow you to easily customize your Blues Cube with the tone and touch preferences of these master players."

      "description": "Take online gaming sound to the next level with BRIDGE CAST, your all-in-one solution for premium livestream audio. This customizable desktop hub is packed with secret weapons to take out the competition, including dual sound mixes, vocal transformer effects, music playback, sound effects, and support for a broadcast-grade mic and headphones. In the heat of the battle, BRIDGE CAST ensures that your audio is always as epic as your gameplay.\n\nThe companion BRIDGE CAST app takes your experience even further, allowing you to customize BRIDGE CAST audio features and enhance streams with royalty-free background music tracks and sound effects via BGM CAST and Roland Cloud.\n\nLearn how BRIDGE CAST's powerful audio tools will elevate your gaming streams with professional sound quality and easy real-time mixing control.\n\nBRIDGE CAST gives you what you need to deliver outstanding sound in every session, coupled with killer sonic tools to help you stand out from the crowd. Roland has been a leading innovator in electronic music and audio/video gear for over 50 years. With BRIDGE CAST on your desktop, you\u2019ll be driving your sound with the brand trusted by generations of top creators worldwide.\n\nConnect BRIDGE CAST to your gaming computer via USB-C.\n\nPlug in a professional microphone to the XLR input.\n\nHook up your headphones.\n\nCustomize the audio and panel functions with the companion app.\n\nSet up personal and stream mixes with the hands-on controls.\n\nBRIDGE CAST lets you chat and interact using a broadcast-grade dynamic or condenser microphone, the foundation of any professional audio setup. The high-performance XLR mic preamp delivers clear, dynamic sound in the box, with no need for messy external add-ons. You get superior audio monitoring too, with a powerful headphone amplifier and high-sensitivity output for pro-quality phones. The versatile headphones connector also supports a headset mic for a quick, single-cable connection.\n\nWith the dual audio mixer in BRIDGE CAST, you can independently balance the mic level, team chats, gameplay sounds, and background music for you and your viewers. Give yourself a winning advantage with a personal mix that prioritizes what you need to hear while gaming. Then create a separate stream mix that\u2019s perfectly balanced for maximum online engagement.\n\nAlong with a headphones output, BRIDGE CAST has a line output for external gaming speakers. Level knobs for each output let you easily control volumes and smoothly transition between phones and speakers during gameplay. There\u2019s also a dedicated streaming level control to dial in the sound for your online audience.\n\nMorph your voice and become your character with fun processing derived from Roland\u2019s famous VT voice transformer products. Adjust the pitch and formant to change your age or gender. Or go even further and take on the persona of a beast or alien.\n\nBRIDGE CAST also includes EQ, compression, and other pro vocal processing to level up your streams. A low-cut filter softens pesky \u201cP\u201d and \u201cT\u201d plosives, while the de-esser cleans up harsh \u201cS\u201d tones. There\u2019s a noise suppressor to throttle background distractions, plus reverb to launch your voice into another dimension. And with the muscular hardware DSP handling the audio load, all your computer power is dedicated to gaming and streaming.\n\nImmerse yourself in 5.1 or 7.1 virtual surround sound for headphones and stereo speaker systems, powered by advanced Roland technology. Audio is converted from a PC to virtual surround sound via a USB connection, delivering a powerful and engaging sound experience.\n\nSlay your competition by highlighting important game sounds with Game EQ presets. Pinpoint audio frequencies and boost their levels to make it easier to hear critical elements, like enemy footsteps in first-person shooter games. You can even fine-tune while visually monitoring the analyzed waveform in real time. Once you find the ideal settings for different game titles, save them in onboard profiles and call them up with quick button presses while playing.\n\nBuilding your brand is an essential part of creating an online following. Choose your core BRIDGE CAST look with bold Black and Ice White finish options. And take it to another level by customizing the detachable faceplate using our downloadable skin template, which allows you to personalize the panel with your team or gamertag design. It\u2019s also possible to customize the LED colors of the four control knobs for additional flair.\n\nThe ergonomic BRIDGE CAST panel lets you easily control your mix while staying focused on the game. Everything you need is at your fingers, including grab-and-go level knobs and assignable buttons for muting sounds and accessing various functions. The rock-solid design won\u2019t move around on your desktop, and the discrete rear-panel connections keep clutter in check.\n\nThe powerful BRIDGE CAST app works in tandem with the hardware, giving you full access to an array of in-depth features. Dial in mic and audio parameters, configure Game EQ presets, and more. You can also re-assign hardware controls for your needs and save/recall custom BRIDGE CAST configurations for different games and streaming audiences.\n\nUsing the BRIDGE CAST app, effortlessly tailor your sound with intuitive microphone settings for speed and precision. The version 5.00 update allows you to adjust EQ with quick-access controls and use the studio-grade compressor to achieve a clean, professional vocal sound with a single fader. There's also an expander that minimizes unwanted background noise without unnatural artifacts.\n\nWith BGM CAST, adding background music and sonic color to streams has never been easier. Available through the BRIDGE CAST app and Roland Cloud, BGM CAST puts a growing selection of royalty-free background music and sound effects at your fingertips. Choose music by mood and genre or create playlists of your favorites for stress-free music management. You can also assign sound effects to the four hardware buttons for instant triggering.\n\nA free Roland Account provides 36 background music tracks and 16 sound effects to use at no charge. Signing up for Roland Cloud Core membership through the BRIDGE CAST app unlocks thousands of additional music tracks and hundreds of sound effects, with new selections added each month.

      "description": "The CB-404 is the official carrying case for the Roland SP-404MKII and previous models in the iconic SP-404 portable sampler series. Streamlined and rugged, it features a semi-rigid EVA shell with a tough polyester exterior and a moveable internal partition that creates separate compartments for the sampler and items such as an AC adaptor. There\u2019s also a detachable pouch for small items, plus a shoulder strap with a wide adjustment range. As a bonus, we\u2019ve also included four orange knobs for customizing the look of the SP-404MKII model.\n\nRoland SP samplers are the bona fide kings of performance-based beatmaking, celebrated for their distinctive sound and ability to create rapid-fire beats anywhere. With the CB-404, you can be sure your SP instrument is well protected no matter where you travel.\n\nThe CB-404\u2019s semi-rigid EVA exterior provides durable protection with reduced weight. An internal partition is secured with hook-and-loop attachments, allowing you to adjust the compartment sizes for different SP-404 models and various accessories. A detachable pouch is fitted into the lid for stowing other small items and features a soft fabric material to protect the sampler\u2019s faceplate.\n\nThe CB-404 includes a tough shoulder strap with a wide adjustment range for different traveling styles. And when you want to carry the case by hand or stow it in a larger bag, simply remove the strap with the easy-to-detach clips.\n\nMany creators like to personalize the knobs and faceplate on the SP-404MKII to match their mood or style. The CB-404 comes with a set of four knobs in classic orange, allowing you to change up the look of your sampler in seconds.\n\nNote: The included knob set only works with the SP-404MKII model and is not available separately.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner\u2019s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "The Roland DJ-202 is a compact two-channel, four-deck forward-thinking Serato DJ Intro controller that gives DJs the features and layout of a full-size pro controller in a rugged mobile unit.\n\nThe DJ-202 is a two-channel, four-deck controller that\u2019s powered via USB and capable of being transported and set up with minimal effort. Its compact, lightweight design and easy-grab handles allow DJs the portability they need for all types of events\u2014mobile applications, house parties, club rocking, beat battles, and more. The intuitive layout of the DJ-202 and its plug-and-play connectivity will have you DJing in no time at all. And with 24-bit/48 kHz fidelity and Roland\u2019s high-resolution audio hardware, your performances will sound amazing on any sound system.\n\nFrom the TR-909's unmistakable hi-hats to the foundation-shaking boom of the TR-808, Roland TR drum machines have defined the sound of entire genres of modern music, from hip-hop, house, techno, and electro in the \u201980s and \u201990s right up to the trap music sound of today. Using Roland\u2019s patented ACB (Analog Circuit Behavior) technology, the DJ-202 faithfully recreates the original sound of these machines, giving you the tools to create rhythm tracks using the same sound palette as the world\u2019s foremost musical icons. The DJ-202\u2019s expanded TR sounds include Bass Drum, Snare Drum, Closed Hat, Open Hat, Tom, Rim, Clap, and Ride, providing a wide range of options to create layered drum sounds and evolving sequences.\n\nScratch and cue with confidence using the DJ-202\u2019s large, low-latency platters, which are the absolute best in its class. Dedicated Serato DJ Lite controls allow quick creation and triggering of hot cues, loops, and samples, plus switching between four decks with the Deck Select button. Use the channel filters or Serato FX (accessible via three FX Select buttons per deck) to finesse blends or accentuate scratches. And with dedicated Play/Pause and Cue buttons, you have the same direct control found on high-end controllers and standalone audio players.\n\nAdd new life to your DJ voice, radio drops, guest vocals, or external instruments via the 1/4-inch TS mic input with onboard reverb and echo FX. Additional vocal effects include low-cut EQ to refine the sound and a noise gate to automatically clean up sound issues and unwanted background noise.\n\nUse the TR drums or your own sounds loaded into Serato Sampler\u2019s four sample slots (with individual sampler volume control) to create the foundation for remixes, beats, and live performances. Program them using the DJ-202\u2019s 16-step sequencer\u2014accessible via the performance pads\u2014and then sync them automatically to your Serato library to create unique transitions, live remixes, or beefed-up classic tracks. Engage Inst-Rec mode for on-the-fly, real-time Serato Sampler sequencing, or use the MIDI output to fluidly sync any MIDI-supported external devices and instruments to your sequencer and Serato DJ Lite. For expanded production capability, upgrade to Serato DJ Pro to access 32 sync-able sampler slots over four banks, the full collection of iZotope FX, software recording capabilities, and more.\n\nMusical mad scientist Dolly Spectra discusses using her body as a MIDI controller in performance, community, and the future of electronic pop.Read more\u2026\n\nThese Quick Start Videos contain step-by-step instructions that will quickly introduce you to its major features.Read more\u2026\n\nCarry bag for the DJ-202 DJ Controller.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner\u2019s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "The Roland DJ-505 is a two-channel, four-deck Serato DJ controller with a portable design, pro-grade build, and advanced feature set, ideal for mobile applications, club DJing, live performance, and music production.\n\nThe DJ-505 is a two-channel, four-deck Serato DJ Pro controller packed with features, and the complete Serato Tool Kit is included as well. Its portability, coupled with a pro-grade build and advanced feature set, makes the DJ-505 ideal for mobile applications, club DJing, live performance, and production purposes alike. The built-in 24-bit/48 kHz audio interface and high-end Roland audio conversion for Master and Booth outputs ensure faithful reproduction of audio sources and clear, powerful sound. Balanced XLR outputs let you connect directly to a professional PA system, and you can monitor your mix via the Booth Outs as well as separate 1/4-inch and 1/8-inch Phones jacks. You also have a 1/4-inch TS mic input to add vocals or external instruments to your performance setup. Dedicated Serato DJ Pro controls allow quick creation and triggering of hot cues, loops, TR sounds, sequencer patterns, and samples, plus switching between four Serato decks with the Deck Select button. Use the channel filters or Serato FX (accessible via three FX Select buttons per deck) to finesse blends or accentuate scratches.\n\nThe DJ-505\u2019s large, low-latency platters provide responsive, lag-free performance that allows for the same style of scratches executed on turntables, and the illuminated outer rings on the jog wheels indicate the status of each deck at a glance. Plus, the DJ-505\u2019s platters have brushed aluminum top plates just like the DJ-808 and DJ-202 controllers, providing both great feel and rugged durability.\n\nFrom the TR-909\u2019s unmistakable hi-hats to the foundation-shaking boom of the TR-808, Roland TR drum machines have defined the sound of entire genres of modern music, from hip-hop, house, techno, and electro in the \u201980s and \u201990s right up to the trap music sound of today. Using Roland\u2019s patented ACB (Analog Circuit Behavior) technology, the DJ-505 faithfully recreates the original sound and character of these classic machines, giving you the ability to program and create rhythm tracks using the same sound palette as the world\u2019s foremost musical icons.\n\nIncluded in the DJ-505 are Bass Drum, Snare Drum, Closed Hat, Open Hat, Tom, Rim, Clap, and Ride sounds from the TR-909, TR-808, TR-707, and TR-606, providing a wide range of options to create layered drum sounds and evolving sequences. The DJ-505 also lets you fine-tune your TR drum sounds and samples using Level, Attack, Decay, and Tune knobs, and easily build sequences with the famous step-based TR-S pad interface.\n\nThe DJ-505\u2019s rich feature set and deep Serato DJ Pro integration empower new creative possibilities for the budding DJ/producer, allowing for remixing, production, and performance all in one compact unit. Use the 16-step sequencer to program drum patterns with sounds from the TR drums or Serato Sampler, and then sync the beats to your Serato DJ Pro tracks to create unique transitions, live remixes, beefed-up classic tracks, or original music. Engage Inst-Rec mode for on-the-fly, real-time sampler sequencing, or use Serato Sampler\u2019s advanced capabilities to layer and sync multiple audio tracks or loops within the eight sampler slots. Finally, the DJ-505 includes a MIDI output to accurately sync your external MIDI devices and instruments to the TR-S sequencer.\n\nThe DJ-505 gives you the tools to not only mix, but also create new music and rhythmic elements on the fly to truly transform the musical dynamic and energy of your performance. From the simple addition of a booming 808 kick drum to a classic track to programming your own beat combined with an acapella, the DJ-505 makes blending multiple musical elements easy and instinctive. Light and portable with road-ready durability, the DJ-505 combines the best hardware performance and sound quality in its class with new possibilities for creative DJs and performing producers.\n\nThese Quick Start Videos contain step-by-step instructions that will quickly introduce you to its major features.Read more\u2026\n\nCarry bag for the DJ-505 DJ Controller.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner\u2019s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

        "High-End DJ Controller, Compact Package\n\nThe DJ-505 is a two-channel, four-deck Serato DJ Pro controller packed with features, and the complete Serato Tool Kit is included as well. Its portability, coupled with a pro-grade build and advanced feature set, makes the DJ-505 ideal for mobile applications, club DJing, live performance, and production purposes alike. The built-in 24-bit/48 kHz audio interface and high-end Roland audio conversion for Master and Booth outputs ensure faithful reproduction of audio sources and clear, powerful sound. Balanced XLR outputs let you connect directly to a professional PA system, and you can monitor your mix via the Booth Outs as well as separate 1/4-inch and 1/8-inch Phones jacks. You also have a 1/4-inch TS mic input to add vocals or external instruments to your performance setup. Dedicated Serato DJ Pro controls allow quick creation and triggering of hot cues, loops, TR sounds, sequencer patterns, and samples, plus switching between four Serato decks with the Deck Select button. Use the channel filters or Serato FX (accessible via three FX Select buttons per deck) to finesse blends or accentuate scratches.",
        "Scratch Friendly\n\nThe DJ-505\u2019s large, low-latency platters provide responsive, lag-free performance that allows for the same style of scratches executed on turntables, and the illuminated outer rings on the jog wheels indicate the status of each deck at a glance. Plus, the DJ-505\u2019s platters have brushed aluminum top plates just like the DJ-808 and DJ-202 controllers, providing both great feel and rugged durability.",
        "The Roland Drum Machine Legacy in a DJ Controller\n\nFrom the TR-909\u2019s unmistakable hi-hats to the foundation-shaking boom of the TR-808, Roland TR drum machines have defined the sound of entire genres of modern music, from hip-hop, house, techno, and electro in the \u201980s and \u201990s right up to the trap music sound of today. Using Roland\u2019s patented ACB (Analog Circuit Behavior) technology, the DJ-505 faithfully recreates the original sound and character of these classic machines, giving you the ability to program and create rhythm tracks using the same sound palette as the world\u2019s foremost musical icons.\n\nIncluded in the DJ-505 are Bass Drum, Snare Drum, Closed Hat, Open Hat, Tom, Rim, Clap, and Ride sounds from the TR-909, TR-808, TR-707, and TR-606, providing a wide range of options to create layered drum sounds and evolving sequences. The DJ-505 also lets you fine-tune your TR drum sounds and samples using Level, Attack, Decay, and Tune knobs, and easily build sequences with the famous step-based TR-S pad interface.",
        "Remix, Produce, Perform\n\nThe DJ-505\u2019s rich feature set and deep Serato DJ Pro integration empower new creative possibilities for the budding DJ/producer, allowing for remixing, production, and performance all in one compact unit. Use the 16-step sequencer to program drum patterns with sounds from the TR drums or Serato Sampler, and then sync the beats to your Serato DJ Pro tracks to create unique transitions, live remixes, beefed-up classic tracks, or original music. Engage Inst-Rec mode for on-the-fly, real-time sampler sequencing, or use Serato Sampler\u2019s advanced capabilities to layer and sync multiple audio tracks or loops within the eight sampler slots. Finally, the DJ-505 includes a MIDI output to accurately sync your external MIDI devices and instruments to the TR-S sequencer.",
        "Road-Ready Remixing On the Go\n\nThe DJ-505 gives you the tools to not only mix, but also create new music and rhythmic elements on the fly to truly transform the musical dynamic and energy of your performance. From the simple addition of a booming 808 kick drum to a classic track to programming your own beat combined with an acapella, the DJ-505 makes blending multiple musical elements easy and instinctive. Light and portable with road-ready durability, the DJ-505 combines the best hardware performance and sound quality in its class with new possibilities for creative DJs and performing producers."

      "description": "DJs don\u2019t just play music\u2014they\u2019re also often the MC, livestream producer, sound tech, and remixer, and sometimes the event organizer too. This hefty workload means they need equipment that supports much more than simply mixing songs together. Say hello to the Roland DJ-707M, an integrated livestreaming sound console, multi-purpose audio interface, loudspeaker management system, and fully fledged performance DJ controller that\u2019s equipped to handle the demanding audio needs of any type of DJ.\n\nThe DJ-707M leverages the DSP of Roland\u2019s digital audio consoles to ensure you deliver the loudest, cleanest sound possible\u2014whether it\u2019s with your own PA system or the one already at the venue. Whatever the gig, your clients will remember great sound thanks to features that handle the unexpected, like laptop crashes, surprise guest performers, videographer feeds, and painful audio challenges such as feedback.\n\nUsing the 10 onboard scenes, you can create \u2018go-to\u2019 event settings for audio routing, loudspeaker management and system setups\u2014and recall them instantly. Scenes are a huge timesaver for standard event configurations, letting you switch settings for your different speaker systems and recall custom setups for venues where you play regularly.\n\nMaster, booth, and zone outputs all have independent loudspeaker management settings, including four-band EQ, multiband compression, limiter, and mono mode. It\u2019s like having three speaker management processors built into one unit.\n\nFeedback at a gig is dangerous as it can ruin a special speech or even plague the whole event. Built-in feedback suppression listens out for feedback\u2014and even anticipates it\u2014before adjusting the speaker output automatically.\n\nConnect two computers at once for a backup laptop connection or seamless DJ changeover. The USB B port also works as a standard USB audio interface capable of two-way communication with an iOS device, perfect for streaming to your favorite social media platform or playing a mix from your phone.\nLearn More About Livestreaming\n\nWhen an event includes a guest musician or performer, you can easily plug them into the front-facing dual 1/4-inch jacks or 1/8-inch stereo aux input without disrupting your DJ configuration.\n\nThe fully assignable zone output with dedicated level control is ideal for creating a separate mix for a videographer, sending different music to another area of the venue, or even adding a subwoofer.\n\nThe compact DJ-707M is packed with more specifications than bulkier controllers that don\u2019t fit in tight DJ booths and are hard to transport without an equipment van.\n\nYou can\u2019t work if your DJ controller isn\u2019t working. Which is why the DJ-707M is built for life on the road, with rugged, reinforced metal parts both inside and out.\n\nThe DJ-707M\u2019s size fits perfectly between turntables and DJ media players. And it\u2019s Serato DVS Upgrade Ready, so you can use it as the ultimate mobile DJ mixer with your component setup.\n\nDJs know that really rocking an event means sounding great on the mic. The DJ-707M\u2019s mic section is designed to handle any situation, from straightforward speeches and announcements to pitch-corrected karaoke throwdowns.\n\nWith the DNA of a professional audio console, the DJ-707M features studio-quality microphone preamps with independent gain, low-cut, and noise gate on each channel.\n\nIndividual on/off, level, three-band EQ, and effect controls let you get the exact right sound for each microphone. And with dedicated hardware effects from clean reverbs and delays to key-based auto-pitching and auto-ducking, you have total command over your vocal sounds.\n\nFor flexibility when you need it, the front-facing aux inputs can be used with microphones\u2014just flip the switch to MIC for the correct level and impedance. This gives you a total of four mic inputs, enough for the whole party to sing along!\n\nAfter all the event planning, set up, speeches, and introductions, you still need to rock the spot and get the crowd dancing. The DJ-707M lets you fully express your skills as a DJ, combining deep Serato DJ Pro integration with creative tools that you\u2019ll only find on Roland DJ controllers.\n\nWith full Serato DJ Pro support, you can use hot cues, loops, rolls, pitch play, slicer, and more. Serato DJ Pro also comes with iZotope audio effects to stylize your sound with simple one-knob control.\n\nWork the perfect scratch or smoothest blend using the rugged crossfader with full-range curve settings and software-adjustable crossfader margin.\n\nRoland\u2019s pristine-sounding hardware effects can be assigned individually to the dedicated Filter/FX knob on each channel, and include Filter, Dub Echo, Jet, Noise, Reverb, Delay, Bit Crush, Phaser, Noise 2, and more.\n\nThere\u2019s a Roland TR drum machine tucked away on Deck 3, so you can accent your songs with classic TR-808 and 909 drum loops or even provide a backing beat for instrumentalists. Setting Deck 4 to OSC lets you drop sweepers, synth stabs, and other onboard DJ sound effects to spice up a mix.\n\nThe Roland DJ-707M DJ Controller for Mobile DJs is an integrated live sound console, loudspeaker management system, and fully-fledged performance Serato DJ Pro controller that\u2019s equipped to handle the demanding audio needs of working Mobile DJs.\n\nAs livestreaming has quickly become a way of life for DJ's to maintain their skill and entertain those at home, the Roland DJ-707M unlocks livestreaming with an iOS device using the second USB port.\n\nThe DJ-707M is a controller that doubles as a tool for mixing, streaming, and music performance.

      "description": "Do you have a passion for music? GO:KEYS 3 makes it easy to go from being a fan to an active music creator. This fun modern keyboard unlocks a simple new approach to making music, encouraging you to explore sounds and ideas in the moment\u2014no previous experience required. Just power on, push a few buttons, and let your imagination flow. And as your skills develop, deeper features allow you to travel as far as your ambition takes you.\n\nWith GO:KEYS 3 under your fingers, you have everything you need to turn your musical dreams into reality.\n\nLearning music doesn\u2019t have to be hard. GO:KEYS 3 invites exploration at every turn, urging your inner creative voice to emerge. The friendly, interactive interface stimulates discovery and spontaneous musical moments, even if you\u2019ve never played an instrument before.\n\nAs many top composers will tell you, playing one note with an inspiring sound is often all it takes to spark a complete idea. GO:KEYS 3 includes over 1000 sounds from Roland\u2019s historic library, which has motivated top music artists in every genre for over 50 years. Journey through a universe of possibilities with the expressive 61-note keyboard, from acoustic pianos and orchestral instruments to modern synthesizers, guitars, drums, and beyond.\n\nOnce you find a sound that energizes you, experiment by creating melodies and arpeggios over automatic musical backing. GO:KEYS 3 is filled with ready-made chord progressions in various styles, all with the immersive sound of a finished record. It\u2019s also possible to craft your own chord sequences, and you can easily find the progressions for your favorite songs online or with dedicated apps.\n\nAs a chord progression loops, discover your own performance style by remixing sounds. Change things up with four variations. Drop parts in and out, including the drums, bass, and backing chords. Swap instruments for a different vibe. And create dynamic energy by processing the entire sound with filtering, lo-fi tones, beat slicing, and other ear-catching performance effects.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve mastered chord progressions, go even further by directing a band of virtual musicians. GO:KEYS 3 offers a wide selection of dynamic accompaniments controlled by one or two left-hand fingers. Jam melodies and solos with your right hand as the band backs every move. Then weave in more sophisticated textures with full left-hand chords as your technique grows.\n\nAt any time, you can instantly capture what you\u2019re doing with GO:KEYS 3 and listen back. Analyze and hone your ideas. Show off your progress with family and friends. Or share your skills with the world on social media.\n\nWith its portable, all-in-one design, you can pick up GO:KEYS 3 and enjoy music anywhere in your living space. The built-in stereo sound system delivers rich, satisfying sound, while support for AA battery power makes setup fast and easy. And when you want to play privately, plug in headphones or earbuds to enjoy GO:KEYS 3 without disturbing others.\n\nListening to your favorite music is a great way to inspire the next creative session. Play songs from your music library via Bluetooth or USB memory and jam along. Then, use the center cancel function to remove the vocals and sing them yourself. GO:KEYS 3 also supports Bluetooth MIDI and audio/MIDI over USB, opening the door to further creative possibilities with music apps on a computer or mobile device.\n\nWant more inspiration? On Roland Cloud, there\u2019s an ever-growing selection of premium sounds and exciting new arranger styles to explore.

      "description": "Introducing the GR-55 Guitar Synthesizer.\n\nTake an in-depth look at the GR-55 Guitar Synthesizer.\n\nJeff Loomis (Nevermore, Sanctuary) talks to Roland about the GR-55 Guitar Synthesizer.\n\nHerman Li of DragonForce talks to Roland about his musical beginnings, his influences, and using the GR-55 Guitar Synthesizer live and in the studio.\n\nSteve Stevens talks to Roland about the GR-55 Guitar Synthesizer.\n\nRobert \u201cBubby\u201d Lewis, bass player for Snoop Dogg and Lupe Fiasco, talks to Roland about the GR-55 Guitar Synthesizer.\n\nAlex Hutchings takes us through his live looping setup using the Roland GR-55 Guitar Synthesizer and BOSS RC-300 Loop Station.\n\nAlex Hutchings demonstrates the GR-55 Guitar Synthesizer (part 1 of 2).\n\nAlex Hutchings demonstrates the GR-55 Guitar Synthesizer (part 2 of 2).\n\nAlex Hutchings shows off the looping capabilities of the GR-55 Guitar Synthesizer.\n\nAlex Hutchings demonstrates the GT-100 and GR-55 at Musikmesse 2012.\n\nRob Marcello demos seven of his custom GR-55 patches\n\nThe GR-55\u2019s powerful triple-core engine comprises two PCM synthesizers (with over 900 tones powered by the latest Roland synthesis technology) and COSM guitar modeling, featuring a virtual treasure trove of guitar, bass, amp, and synth models. Together, these combined technologies allow you to create unique, revolutionary sounds. The \u201cMetal Synth Lead\u201d preset, for example, combines two types of thick, brilliant synth textures with an overdriven solid-body/humbucking tone for incredible punch and power.\n\nThanks to Roland\u2019s decades of research and dedication to guitar synthesizers and powerful new pitch detection technology, the GR-55 is far and away the fastest guitar synth ever. Furthermore, the COSM guitar-modeling engine needs zero detection time, allowing the GR-55 to respond instantly and exactly as you play. The GR-55 detects pitch, velocity, and behavior for unprecedented response to your performance.\n\nGet ready to rock\u2026and fast! The GR-55 puts you instantly in touch with a huge library of amazing sounds, no editing required. The onboard lineup of ready-to-use presets (270, plus 297 user) takes the pain out of the process, with simple category buttons for finding the perfect sound fast. Choose from hundreds of great presets for pop, rock, and beyond, and kick-start your song or jam with unique, powerful sounds that will turn heads and raise fists.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to the world of technology, fear not. The GR-55 is powerful yet extremely friendly. For customizing sounds, the EZ Edit feature (made famous in the GT-10) and large LCD takes the guesswork out of the process. And for those who want to go deep, the GR-55 offers huge array of controllable parameters. Pros will appreciate the power of the GR-55 while beginners will love how quick and easy the unit is to operate.\n\nThe GR-55 conveniently bridges the guitarist to the desktop music production world with its two USB ports. The rear-panel port can be used one for MIDI/Audio data communication; the side-panel port is dedicated to real-time playback of audio files from a USB memory device (sold separately). The GR-55 provides foot control of USB audio playback so your hands never need to leave the guitar.\n\nRob Marcello demos seven of his custom GR-55 patches\n\nWe talk to GN\u2019R\u2019s longest-serving guitarist about Roland and BOSS gear old and new before the band lights up London\u2019s Wembley Arena.Read more\u2026\n\nJoin us as we explore the incredible history of V-Guitar, culminating in 2025\u2019s mind-blowing VG-800 V-Guitar Processor.Read more\u2026\n\nRecording artist Nate Mercereau explains how he is redefining the role of the guitarist with Roland and BOSS guitar synthesizers.Read more\u2026\n\nImmerse yourself in the world of guitar synthesis and learn about the history and technology that power these powerful sound-creation tools.Read more\u2026\n\nDivided pickup offering possibility of GK-devices to guitarists.\n\nDivided pickup offering possibility of GK-devices to bassists.\n\nSpecial cable to connect GK-compatible guitar gear.\n\nAdvanced control station for any performance-based MIDI instrument or device.\n\nFloor pedal unit to control and switch between two GK-compatible devices.\n\nFender Stratocaster with embedded GK-3 functionality and built-in 13-pin connector.\n\nHigh-quality 2GB USB memory key that\u2019s compatible with the high-speed USB (USB 2.0) specification.\n\nPremium Closed-Back Studio Headphones for Pro Level Monitoring.\n\nThis is the GR-55 driver for Microsoft(R) Windows(R) 8 / 8.1 64-bit Edition / 32-bit Edition.\n\nThis is the GR-55 driver for Microsoft(R) Windows(R) 7 64-bit Edition / 32-bit Edition.\n\nThis is the GR-55 driver for Microsoft(R) Windows Vista(R) 32-bit Edition / 64-bit Edition.\n\nThis is the GR-55 driver for Microsoft(R) Windows(R) XP Home Edition/Professional.\n\nThis is the GR-55 driver for OS X 10.11.\n\nThis is a driver for using the GR-55 on OS X 10.10.\n\nThis is a driver for using the GR-55 on OS X 10.9.\n\nThis is a driver for using the GR-55 on OS X 10.8.\n\nThis is a driver for using the GR-55 on Mac OS X v10.7.\n\nThis is a driver for using the GR-55 on Mac OS X v10.6.\n\nThis is a driver for using the GR-55 on Mac OS X 10.4/10.5.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner\u2019s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

        "New Sound Possibilities\n\nThe GR-55\u2019s powerful triple-core engine comprises two PCM synthesizers (with over 900 tones powered by the latest Roland synthesis technology) and COSM guitar modeling, featuring a virtual treasure trove of guitar, bass, amp, and synth models. Together, these combined technologies allow you to create unique, revolutionary sounds. The \u201cMetal Synth Lead\u201d preset, for example, combines two types of thick, brilliant synth textures with an overdriven solid-body/humbucking tone for incredible punch and power.",
        "Lightning-Fast Tracking\n\nThanks to Roland\u2019s decades of research and dedication to guitar synthesizers and powerful new pitch detection technology, the GR-55 is far and away the fastest guitar synth ever. Furthermore, the COSM guitar-modeling engine needs zero detection time, allowing the GR-55 to respond instantly and exactly as you play. The GR-55 detects pitch, velocity, and behavior for unprecedented response to your performance.",
        "Instant Gratification\n\nGet ready to rock\u2026and fast! The GR-55 puts you instantly in touch with a huge library of amazing sounds, no editing required. The onboard lineup of ready-to-use presets (270, plus 297 user) takes the pain out of the process, with simple category buttons for finding the perfect sound fast. Choose from hundreds of great presets for pop, rock, and beyond, and kick-start your song or jam with unique, powerful sounds that will turn heads and raise fists.",
        "Easy to Use\n\nIf you\u2019re new to the world of technology, fear not. The GR-55 is powerful yet extremely friendly. For customizing sounds, the EZ Edit feature (made famous in the GT-10) and large LCD takes the guesswork out of the process. And for those who want to go deep, the GR-55 offers huge array of controllable parameters. Pros will appreciate the power of the GR-55 while beginners will love how quick and easy the unit is to operate.",
        "USB Connectivity\n\nThe GR-55 conveniently bridges the guitarist to the desktop music production world with its two USB ports. The rear-panel port can be used one for MIDI/Audio data communication; the side-panel port is dedicated to real-time playback of audio files from a USB memory device (sold separately). The GR-55 provides foot control of USB audio playback so your hands never need to leave the guitar."

      "description": "The feature-rich KS-11Z provides a rugged, attractive, and stable platform for 88-note stage pianos and other portable keyboards. Steel construction offers robust performance, while multiple adjustment points allow you to tailor the stand\u2019s width and height for any home, stage, or studio setup. Assembly is fast and easy with integrated push pins and foldable padded support arms.\n\nFor over five decades, Roland has been a worldwide leader in stage pianos, synthesizers, and other keyboards for musicians from hobbyist to professional. The KS-11Z is filled with smart design details informed by our long development knowledge, delivering a premium experience for all types of instruments. Heavy-duty steel construction and a solid Z shape provide rock-solid stability in a minimal footprint, making it a great solution for supporting 88-note pianos in the RD and FP series and other heavy keyboards.\n\nThe KS-11Z is designed for precision adjustment, with a quick-release lever that enables you to set the width to any position within a wide range.\n\nYou can sometimes come across uneven surfaces on performance stages and in studio environments. The KS-11Z features adjustable feet to eliminate wobble and dial in the perfect balance for your situation.\n\nThe KS-11Z features a foldable design for transport and storage. When you\u2019re ready to use the stand, simply unfold the padded arms and they will automatically lock in place. And when the gig\u2019s over, press the buttons to release the pins and fold the arms back down.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner\u2019s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "Produce and perform music anywhere, anytime\u2014without clutter or complications. The MC-101 GROOVEBOX has all the high-quality sounds, sequencing, and effects of the expansive MC-707 in a compact four-track version that\u2019s go-everywhere portable. Get started with an inspiring collection of ready-to-go sounds and patterns, or easily create your own. Craft a unique style by importing custom sounds, loops, and clips that sync to tempo. And you can perform with the MC-101, triggering clips and shaping your sounds with direct, hands-on control.\n\nThe MC-101 is a professional production tool, sharing the sounds and many of the capabilities of its bigger sibling, the MC-707. And there are advantages to being small. The MC-101 is solid-yet-light and runs for about five hours on four AA batteries, so you can design sounds, create drum patterns, and compose musical phrases just about anywhere. And it\u2019s not just a scratch pad for simple ideas. You can produce fully fledged professional tracks or create backing tracks and accompaniment for live performance.\n\nThe MC-101 has a four-track sequencer optimized for creating today\u2019s electronic and dance-focused music. You can use the 16 RGB pads to create drum, bass, and synthesizer patterns and produce your own original music. Explore a musical playground where you can freely combine loops and one-shots with melodic phrases, including your own MIDI sequences and imported audio recordings. Compose and chain scenes or clips, rearrange, re-sample, record automation, and more. Or share clips with other MC-101, MC-707, and VERSELAB MV-1 users for remote collaboration.\n\nThe MC-101 uses the ZEN-Core Synthesis System\u2014the most advanced synth engine we\u2019ve ever made. ZEN-Core delivers the Roland sounds that have defined electronic and dance genres for over forty years. Legendary instruments like the TR-808, TR-909, JUNO-106, and SH-101 are all here, ready to replicate classic sounds or be combined, tweaked, and processed into entirely new sounds.\nMore About ZEN-Core\n\nCompose from a curated collection of projects with built-in beats, phrases, and sounds, all expertly crafted by renowned artists and sound designers\u2014with even more available to download.\nExplore Projects\n\nThe MC-101 is also compatible with ZEN-Core Sound Packs. So when you\u2019re ready for more sounds, or want to explore new genres and styles, it\u2019s easy to change things up.\nExplore Sounds\n\nEach track contains a powerful sample player so you can import your own custom sounds. Use your own voice or the sound of a favorite instrument from your computer. Imported audio can sync with the MC-101\u2019s tempo or be processed with the arsenal of built-in effects and hands-on controls.\n\nWith the MC-101\u2019s wide range of pro effects, your music sounds polished and fully produced. Each track has independent effects processors with a huge number of variations. Lush chorus brings depth to pads and other synth sounds. Delays and reverbs create evocative spaces and add movement to delicate sequences. Overdrive, distortion, and amp simulation inject grit and intensity into synths, guitars, drums, and more. You can also run your entire mix through master effects like filters, bit-crushers, and a master bus compressor that glues it all together with punch and clarity.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to develop tracks further or share your creations with friends and fans, simply connect the MC-101 to your computer with a single USB cable. It has advanced USB audio interface capabilities and can record an entire mix or all four parts to individual tracks in your DAW. Or sample sounds from your DAW to capture backing tracks, stems, or the sound of a favorite software synth for your next live show.\n\nThe MC-101 GROOVEBOX has all the high-quality sounds, sequencing, and effects of the professional MC-707, in a compact four-track version that\u2019s go-everywhere portable.\n\nIn this video, Peter Brown gives you an overview of the beatmaking possibilities of the Roland MC-101.

      "description": "The MC-707 GROOVEBOX has everything you need to create a song or perform a live set without a computer. Immerse yourself in eight tracks of recording, sequencing, synthesizers, and effects, plus a curated palette of sounds, loops, and phrases. Record audio and MIDI\u2014with deep control over timing\u2014and tweak the faders and knobs for that \u201cin the moment\u201d experience. With such massive potential, you\u2019re ready to produce in any style or create your own new thing.\n\nThis modern GROOVEBOX packs a lot of punch in a single piece of gear. It\u2019s deep and customizable, yet fun and friendly, always ready to create something new. Compose from a curated collection of built-in sounds, beats, and phrases all expertly crafted by renowned artists and sound designers. Explore a musical playground where you can freely combine loops and one-shots with melodic phrases, including your own audio recordings and MIDI sequences. Record and share clips, chain Scenes, re-arrange, re-sample, record automation, and make it all sound huge with per-track and global effects.\n\nThe MC-707\u2019s eight-track sequencer is optimized for fluid production of today\u2019s electronic-focused music styles. Quickly build parts with the TR-REC step sequencer found on classic Roland drum machines and use the 16 ultra-sensitive pads to play and record drum parts, melodic basslines, or polyphonic chord progressions. Sequences are stored in clips that contain your sounds and note data, plus real-time or drawn automation for creating effect changes, slow filter sweeps, and much more. You can capture clips in Scenes to perform complete songs, and use creative tools like note repeat, chord designer, and step LFO to supercharge new ideas.\n\nThe MC-707 lets you dig deep into our most advanced synth engine ever\u2014the ZEN-Core Synthesis System. Fusing virtual analog, modeling, and modern PCM, the MC-707 has the sounds of legendary Roland rhythm machines and synthesizers that are the foundation of electronic music, including the TR-808, TR-909, TB-303, JUNO-106, and SH-101. But the MC-707 also looks forward, with modern digital and hybrid sounds perfect for creating future classics today.\nMore About ZEN-Core\n\nIn addition to its deep synthesis engine, the MC-707 has a powerful sampler with on-the-fly recording that synchronizes to your project\u2019s tempo. Record vocals or instrument parts, or import from your own existing library, then sequence or trigger phrases, one-shots, and loops. You can also tweak and mangle samples by slicing, truncating, and reversing\u2014with the inspiration and precision that comes only from hands-on control.\n\nWith the MC-707\u2019s massive effects palette, your music sounds polished and fully produced. All eight tracks have independent effects processors with a huge number of variations. Lush chorus brings depth to pads and other synth sounds. Delays and reverbs create evocative spaces and add movement to delicate sequences. Overdrive, distortion, and amp simulation inject grit and intensity into synths, guitars, drums, and more. You can process external audio and run your entire mix through master effects like filters, bit-crushers, and a master bus compressor that glues it all together with punch and clarity.\n\nLoaded with tactile controls, the MC-707 lets you dig in and shape your music in a visceral, physical way. Faders for each track let you immediately mix and arrange parts, and knobs can be freely assigned to any control you need. You can even record your knob movements so they play back automatically. And the 8x2 pad array is not only great for playing drums and triggering clips\u2014you can generate repeating rhythms, create melodies, constrain to any kind of scale, and trigger complex chords.\n\nWith its advanced USB audio interface capabilities, the MC-707 easily flows in and out of your production setup. You can record all eight parts to individual DAW tracks and finish your song there. Or sample sounds from your DAW to capture backing tracks, stems, or the sound of a favorite software synth for your next live show.\n\nThe MC-707 is an updateable and expandable platform that never gets stale. Keep things fresh with projects that contain new loops, one-shots, phrases, and synth sounds\u2014all available online.\nExplore Projects\n\nAnd since the MC-707 uses the ZEN-Core Synthesis System, you can get loads of new sounds with ZEN-Core Sound Packs, available via Roland Cloud Manager.\nExplore Sounds\n\nThe MC-707 GROOVEBOX has everything you need to create a song or perform a live set without a computer.

      "description": "The P-6 Creative Sampler packs renowned Roland sampling technology into a pocket-size gadget with sophisticated granular sound design options and a powerful sequencer. Equipped with an onboard mic, intuitive controls, USB-C connectivity, and a versatile stash of hands-on MFX, the P-6 delivers exceptional sampling and performance capabilities anywhere you go.\n\nThe P-6 is ideal for any level of music creator, from beginner to pro. Get started right away with top-level tactile controls and pads for jamming and sound tweaking. Then, go deeper with advanced features for cutting-edge sonic manipulation and performance.\n\nWhether using the built-in mic, analog inputs, or a smartphone via USB-C, the P-6 is always ready to sample at a moment\u2019s notice. After capturing sounds, quickly chop longer samples into preset sections for triggering from the onboard keyboard. Or easily build custom collections of multiple sounds with streamlined Step Sampling. Want to rough up the sound? Get gritty with our trademark lo-fi effects. Need some layers? Resample your creations to add depth and evolving complexity.\n\nStep into a universe of microscopic sound design with the advanced granular sampling tools in the P-6. Transform tiny moments into sonic landscapes with extensive sound design parameters. Detune samples, adjust the grain shape, play with head position, head speed, spread, and more. From clean and pristine to beautifully mangled, it\u2019s easy to conjure new sound dimensions with a twist of a knob or a press of a button.\n\nBreathe life into your sequences with deep features that push the boundaries of music programming. Jam with 64-step patterns powered by dynamic sequencing elements like motion recording, probability, micro-timing, off-grid sequencing, and sub steps. Plus, manipulate playback in real-time with Step Loop for instant stutter effects and creative improvisation.\n\nSupercharge performances and production with an array of curated, hands-on MFX. Transform and manipulate your sounds with legendary effects and a selection of new classics. Grab and go with favorites like Vinyl Simulator, DJFX Looper, Stopper, Lo-fi, Scatter, Phaser, and Resonator. Using BUS FX routing, selectively apply MFX or assign delay and reverb independently to any sample.\n\nThe P-6 SampleTool software for macOS and Windows is a handy companion for editing and transferring samples from your computer to the P-6. Clean up clicks with snap to zero, truncate to remove unwanted sections, normalize to standardize audio levels, and downsample for reduced sample resolution. When you\u2019re ready, simply drag and drop the samples directly to the P-6 hardware for seamless integration and playback.\n\nThe P-6 is immensely fun as a standalone instrument but becomes even more powerful when connected to other devices. Build a portable creative ecosystem by linking with the S-1 Tweak Synth, T-8 Beat Machine, and other AIRA Compacts or gadget instruments. Take it further by streaming your entire gadget chain from the P-6 to a smartphone, tablet, or laptop over USB-C for content creation or easy integration with your favorite music software. The setup is plug-and-play, with no driver installation needed.\n\nThe P-6 is as portable as it gets, ready to record anywhere you like. Create freely with up to three hours of lithium-ion battery life per charge, supported by a rugged Roland build that assures years of enjoyment ahead.\n\nCreate infectious tracks in seconds flat with a miniature rhythm factory powered by pristine TR drums plus bass from the inimitable TB-303.\n\nPairing a powerful chord sequencer with the lavish tones of the legendary JUNO-60, this portable synth toolbox has the building blocks you need to bring harmonic substance to your jams.\n\nThis outrageously jammable effects box harmonizes, auto-pitches, vocodes, loops, and glitches your voice and anything else you feed it.\n\nDivine a new world of sonic textures with a potent micro polysynth and sound design playground inspired by the legendary SH-101.\n\nThe P-6 Creative Sampler joins the AIRA Compact gang, packing legendary Roland sampling technology into a compact, user-friendly gadget.\n\nIn this tutorial, Dustin Good explores the P-6\u2019s powerful features and offers tips for mastering this wildly jammable instrument.\n\nLearn how the pandemic-born music organization provides \u201cinclusive, real-world creative arts experiences\" in this exclusive conversation.Read more\u2026\n\nLearn the origin story of vocal harmonizers and processors and explore the science behind creating vocal harmonies with music technology.Read more\u2026\n\nThe multifaceted artist discusses his career encompassing everything from jazz-inflected percussion to art installations.Read more\u2026\n\nJoin the 404 Day worldwide takeover with community-driven SP-powered events, showcases, workshops, and interactive demos.Read more\u2026\n\nThe P-6 is a compact sampler capable of a wide range of sample processing and compositional techniques. Learn to use this flexible, portable instrument.Read more\u2026\n\nGraphical editor software for the P-6 Creative Sampler.\n\nCustom case for AIRA Compact instruments.\n\nMIDI cable with right-angle 3.5mm TRS connectors, 1 ft./30 cm length.

      "description": "The SYSTEM-8 is a direct result of over four decades of synthesizer development at Roland, including some of the most iconic instruments ever made. It absolutely nails the sound and behavior of our most sought-after classics, like the included JUPITER-8, JUNO-106 and JX-3P synthesizers\u2014and yet it does so much more. Mix and match modern and vintage oscillators and filter types with multiple dedicated effects\u2014then split and layer them into never-before-heard new sounds. Shape every detail with the huge array of high-resolution controls and create fully realized musical ideas with the onboard polyphonic sequencer with motion recording.\n\nThe SYSTEM-8\u2019s synth architecture draws on our deep history of research and development\u2014and it includes authentic models of classic oscillators, filters and effects. It even has down-to-the-circuit recreations of the JUPITER-8, JUNO-106 and JX-3P built-in, not to mention the world of legendary synths available on Roland Cloud. But the SYSTEM-8 goes way beyond vintage. It has multiple flavors of digital and analog-style oscillators including Saw, Square, Triangle, SuperSaw, FM and more completely unique waveforms. Filter options include the famous JUPITER and JUNO filters as well as more recent designs like the unique Side Band Filter. Ever wondered what a knobby, FM synth with a JUPITER-8 filter would be like? Now you can find out. Able to split, layer and combine different synth engines, the SYSTEM-8 is unparalleled in its versatility, going from glass to growl, or pluck to punch, with just a few tweaks of its high-resolution controls.\n\nThe SYSTEM-8 features three expansion slots for hosting and controlling PLUG-OUT synths, which are complete, 100-percent authentic models of Roland classics that you can swap in and out whenever you like. JUPITER-8, JUNO-106, and JX-3P PLUG-OUTs are included, and it\u2019s possible to combine the native synth engine and any hosted PLUG-OUTs to create super-synth patches with layered voices and custom splits. The growing PLUG-OUT instrument collection on Roland Cloud includes the JUNO-60, SH-2, SH-101, PROMARS, SYSTEM-100, and many others, and they also work as DAW plug-ins that you can control from the SYSTEM-8\u2019s panel.\n\nWith one of the most expansive control layouts available, the SYSTEM-8 has dozens of knobs, sliders, and buttons for you to shape your sound. Dimmable lights give you feedback as to which controls are active and let you see what\u2019s happening in dim studios and dark stages. Controls have a logical, flowing, layout with tonal tweaking in mind. You\u2019ll get ultra-smooth parameter changes that sound great and help you find the sweet spots.\n\nThe SYSTEM-8\u2019s polyphonic sequencer is designed to be quick and flowing, keeping up with the rapid pace of your musical ideas. The upper and lower layers of the SYSTEM-8 each have their own dedicated sequencer which can trigger internal sounds or devices connected via USB, standard MIDI, or CV/GATE. You can record in step or real-time modes and the sequencer can even capture per-step or real-time parameter changes using motion recording. Keep things fresh and exciting with dedicated knobs for scale, gate, and shuffle as well as hands-on control of playback modes and direction.\n\nWith extensive support for audio and MIDI over USB, the SYSTEM-8 integrates perfectly into your studio setup or live rig. It functions as a high-resolution audio interface making live performance and on-the-road production setups clean and simple. The 49-full size keys are responsive, and the huge array of lighted knobs and sliders mean you can control your favorite plugin instruments with an interface made for tweaking synthesizers, instead of rows of generic controls. Many Roland Cloud synths even have modes that mimic the SYSTEM-8\u2019s layout so you get automatic and intuitive one-to-one control.\n\nIn addition to its full complement of MIDI and USB connections, the SYSTEM-8 also has built-in CV/GATE outputs, meaning it works as well with analog and modular gear as it does with software plugins. In fact, it\u2019s the ideal centerpiece to the wide world of Eurorack modules and hybrid setups. You can use the high-quality 49-key keyboard to play your modular synths or use the advanced sequencer to send note and pitch data to external gear in perfect sync.\n\nPowerful and deep, the SYSTEM-8 delivers a vast palette of sounds inspired by over four decades of legendary Roland synths.\n\nJUNO-106 PLUG-OUT Sound Preview\n\nThis video introduces the JUNO-106 PLUG-OUT for the Roland SYSTEM-8 Synthesizer.

The future is back\u2014and it\u2019s in your hands.\n\nMeet the TR-1000 Rhythm Creator, Roland\u2019s most advanced drum machine ever. Built from the ground up with input from influential artists and the community, the TR-1000 combines analog warmth, digital precision, stereo sampling, and deep sequencing in a single modern instrument. Whether you're a producer, performer, or sound designer, this is the rhythm machine you've been waiting for.\n\nWatch Kuniyuki Takahashi unlock the expressive power of the TR-1000 in this electrifying performance. Renowned for his deep musicality and genre-defying sound, Kuniyuki brings the next-generation rhythm machine to life with nuance, texture, and soul.\n\nImmerse yourself in a sonic journey with visionary composer and modular synth artist Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith, as she explores the TR-1000 Rhythm Creator\u2019s range. In this exclusive performance, Kaitlyn blends custom samples, ethereal soundscapes, and native TR tones to push the boundaries of rhythm and sound.\n\nStep into the groove with legendary electro pioneer Egyptian Lover as he brings his signature sound to the TR-1000 drum machine. Watch as he channels classic beats, futuristic rhythms, and that unmistakable West Coast energy.\n\nFrom the foundational to the experimental, the TR-1000 does it all. Conceive, create, and perform with a complete range of premium drum sounds, powered by analog, digital, and sampling engines with advanced tone-shaping and layered track architecture.\n\nThe TR-1000 is the first Roland drum machine with a true analog engine in over 40 years. It features 16 of the most coveted circuits from the TR-808 and TR-909, faithfully recreated from the original designs with detailed engineering and carefully selected modern components. Fusing vintage soul with expanded control, this engine delivers the authentic analog TR sound, boosted with new parameters and vastly expanded dynamic range.\n\nAlongside the TR-1000\u2019s analog sounds are powerful digital engines driven by Roland\u2019s latest modeling technology. Our ACB (Analog Circuit Behavior) platform provides detailed analog circuit emulations, including 21 circuit-bent 8X and 9X models. Drawing from the 808 and 909, these new voices include quick-access parameters for live shaping and expanded controls that push the sound far beyond the range of conventional analog. You also get FM percussion, virtual analog synthesis, and a deep library of PCM samples for sonic exploration and fresh digital textures.\n\nClassic TR instruments laid the foundations for countless electronic music genres\u2014and when paired with digital sampling, their influence deepened. Comprehensive sample tools are fully integrated into the TR-1000 workflow, including stereo sampling and resampling, BPM sync, seamless time-stretching, and non-destructive slice editing. The onboard 64 GB memory comes with a curated collection of 2,000 samples, with 46 GB free for your own captures, edits, and sample imports.\n\nRefine and transform with the TR-1000\u2019s rich palette of tactile effects. Shape sounds with the new analog state-variable filter (SVF) inspired by classic Roland OTA designs. Add saturated punch using the dedicated analog drive. Color tones with digital favorites like crusher, filter, isolator, saturator, pitch delay, flanger, and more. Enhance the mix with reverb and delay sends for each track, and then add additional flavor and movement with a slate of master effects.\n\nPowerful in-line processing makes it easy to sculpt distinctive and dynamic rhythms with the TR-1000. Each track combines a model-specific sound generator, compressor, multimode filter/four-band EQ, and amp/envelope control. Four of the available tracks allow for two independent sound generators to be stacked or programmed separately, complete with per-track FX, internal sidechaining, output routing, and a three-target LFO.\n\nThe TR-1000\u2019s advanced sequencer expands the legendary TR workflow with a focus on feel and flexibility. Program sounds fast, perform with intent, and shape rhythms in real time using extensive pattern tools, expressive controls, and deep timing options.\n\nThe TR-1000 makes sequencing feel alive, whether you\u2019re programming tight techno patterns or drifting into loose, lopsided grooves. Lock in with classic TR-REC step input, real-time recording, or new off-grid options to push or pull the pocket. Flexible input modes let you dial in the right feel and nudge individual steps until the groove hits just right.\n\nIntuitive tools give you the power to program grooves that breathe and evolve with every pass. Use motion recording to capture live parameter changes for modulation and movement. Control how each track progresses with direction settings like forward, reverse, pendulum, and more. Define cycle conditions to determine when steps play and tap into per-step probability to introduce variation and surprise.\n\nFrom machine-locked rhythms to grooves with a human feel, the TR-1000 flows smoothly with your timing preferences. Use quantization to keep things tight. Or turn it off to capture natural rhythmic variations. Dial in shuffle per track to apply distinct amounts of swing and instantly shift playback timing left/right for quick variations and new rhythmic feels.\n\nKeep your entire studio or live setup unified with the TR-1000 as the centerpiece. Thanks to a wide range of connectivity options, you can effortlessly lock with Eurorack hardware, vintage gear, and DAWs. With the Sync Delay parameter, you can store micro-timing adjustments at the project level for perfect synchronization every time.\n\nThe TR-1000 introduces a comprehensive song mode for hands-free playback of complex arrangements, bringing a new level of performance freedom to multi-instrumentalists, singers, and hybrid performers. Link patterns and variations in any order, repeat sections, and build full tracks with ease.\n\nThe TR-1000 is made to be played. With a free-flowing layout and loads of direct-access controls, you have instant command over every performance detail.\n\nThe TR-1000\u2019s ergonomic panel encourages exploration and real-time creation. Sculpted, high-grip knobs and smooth, responsive faders are built for riding levels, shaping FX, and working transitions with pinpoint precision.\n\nDurable keys with RGB indicators deliver an expressive, time-tested matrix for rhythm creation and sound control. Use them for classic TR-REC step programming, tapping out drums in real time, changing dynamics with 16 velocity steps, sample slicing, and more.\n\nThe new Morph slider brings another level of expression to the TR experience. It can be assigned to a wide combination of parameters, enabling wild macro control, smooth transitions, and radical transformations with simple movements. Unique Morph settings are available in each pattern to light up your performances with color and energy.\n\nWith the TR-1000\u2019s new snapshot feature, you can program playable step buttons that instantly recall any knob position for an instrument. Up to 16 snapshots are available per track, perfect for switching up sounds, FX settings, or mix levels with quick presses as you work.\n\nMade for seamless integration with hybrid setups, modular rigs, and modern studios, the TR-1000 offers the I/O and routing flexibility to support expansive production and performance setups.\n\nThe TR-1000 features a main stereo output, an analog FX output, and ten jacks that function as individual audio outputs or analog triggers for external gear. You also have dedicated trigger I/O, a filter/CV input, a clock out, and a dual mono/stereo input for sampling and processing signals through TR effects. Finally, there\u2019s a front-panel headphone jack with its own level control for easy monitoring.\n\nThe TR-1000 functions as a multi-channel USB-C audio/MIDI interface that connects with your favorite computer platform. The versatile USB device port supports flash drives for system updates, data backup/restore, and WAV audio import/export, plus USB MIDI controllers such as the Roland A-49 or A-PRO series. Comprehensive MIDI I/O is available too, along with DIN sync to lock with pre-MIDI synths and drum machines.\n\nThe TR-1000 App allows you to control the hardware from your computer, offering a large display for real-time parameter editing, a librarian for organizing your personal sound collection, and more.\n\nVIEW APP\n\nDesigned with a future-focused architecture, the TR-1000 is a long-term creative partner made to evolve with you.\n\nRoland\u2019s engineers created the original TRs, laying the foundation for decades of rhythm innovation. But it was artists who brought those machines to life. With the TR-1000, we worked closely with today\u2019s producers and performers to craft an instrument grounded in real-world creativity and the features that forward-thinking artists need.\n\nMany TR-808s and TR-909s remain in daily use over four decades after their creation.

      "description": "Roland TR drum machines have impacted music for over 40 years\u2014and they\u2019re as influential now as ever. Based on the much-loved TR-8S, the compact and affordable TR-6S has the same speaker-pummeling, window-rattling, body-moving sound of its bigger sibling. Elevate your drum tracks, make beats on the go, and experience the joy of hands-on production. With the TR-6S, the sound of classic tracks, today\u2019s trends, and tomorrow\u2019s hits are always within reach.\n\nWith the TR-6S, you get six tracks of advanced drum sequencing and the most iconic rhythm sounds in music history\u2014all in a battery-powered box that fits just about anywhere. And like other Roland drum machines, it\u2019s fun and inspiring. With the familiar step sequencer plus dedicated faders and knobs, it\u2019s easy to craft custom beats with visceral, hands-on control.\n\nThe TR-6S includes faithful recreations of the TR-808, TR-606, TR-909, TR-707, and TR-727, along with several modified versions. You also get the CR-78 CompuRhythm, a direct predecessor of the TR-808 that\u2019s left its own indelible footprint on pop classics from the 1980s and beyond. And these aren't sample packs or cheap knock-offs\u2014they're living, breathing replicas that sound and behave just like their vintage counterparts. Going further, you can mix and match these sounds with preset and custom samples and futuristic FM tones, creating exotic hybrid kits that reflect your unique taste and style.\n\nThe sound of today's music owes a lot to the classic step sequencer\u2014particularly the \u201cTR-REC\u201d variety found in early Roland drum machines. The TR-6S employs the same tried-and-true approach, enhanced with real-time recording and modern features like sub steps for ratcheted parts, probability for creating unpredictability, and motion recording for 808 basslines that bounce and rhythms that move.\n\nCreate punch, space, warmth, or grit with the array of high-quality effects in the TR-6S. Vital compressors and EQs are at your fingertips, along with lush reverb, delay, and modulation effects. Push your creative boundaries with filters, LFOs, and wild new effects that incite sonic mayhem.\n\nThe TR-6S is a also a high-quality USB audio/MIDI interface, perfect for mobile or minimal production setups. And it fits in even the most space-starved studios or live rigs, so you can turn life into music whenever inspiration strikes.\n\nEnhance your workflow with TR-EDITOR, a fluid computer-based editor and librarian for the TR-6S. Nimbly design and edit patterns and kits with the intuitive graphic interface, which features a wide array of onscreen parameters and access to deeper FM editing. And with the large display, it\u2019s easy to manage your entire library. Download TR-EDITOR for free today through Roland Cloud Manager, the software interface for Roland Cloud content.\nTR-EDITOR\n\nThe TR-8S and TR-6S Rhythm Performers continue their sonic evolution with TR-8S v3.0 and TR-6S v2.0 updates.\n\nDrummer, DJ, and electronic visionary Rusty Egan helped shape Britain's New Romantic pulse\u2014from Visage's \"Fade to Grey\" to the Blitz Club.Read more\u2026\n\nFollowing the release of the soundtrack to Bruce LaBruce's film The Visitor, Hannah Holland examines the path from club kid to DJ to music producer.Read more\u2026\n\nFrom Africa to the United Kingdom, eclectic dance star Junior Simba shares his passion for infusing ethnic sounds into his songcraft.Read more\u2026\n\nBefore the TR-808 and TR-909 changed hip-hop and dance, the CR-78 changed pop. Here's the story of the last Roland organ-top rhythm machine.Read more\u2026\n\nGraphical editor/librarian software for the TR-8S and TR-6S Rhythm Performers.\n\nCompatible with Apple Mac series (Intel-based).\nCompatible with Apple Silicon Mac (using the M1 chip).\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner\u2019s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.\n\nCompatible with Apple Mac series (Intel-based).\nCompatible with Apple Silicon Mac (using the M1 chip).",

      "description": "Born of the most famous and influential drum machines ever made, the TR-8S combines the best of its Roland heritage with modern production techniques and comprehensive sound design. The result? The most complete drum machine to date\u2014a forward-thinking, performance-tuned instrument unlike any other. Build your dream kit from the most iconic drum sounds of all time, otherworldly FM sounds, and the finest selection of samples from our vast library\u2014or go even further by importing your own custom samples. Tap, tune, and tweak with hands-on controls and production tools that make your patterns move and groove. And why keep this kind of percussive power confined to the studio?\n\nThe TR-8S was literally made to play live.\n\nThe TR-8S comes loaded with the largest, most authentic collection of iconic Roland drum machines available. The powerful processor gives our next-generation ACB models a whole new level of detail and nuance with that classic boom, snap, and sizzle. Enrich the core drums with a spectrum of futuristic and editable FM sounds, plus preset and custom samples for unique hybrid and layered kits. Then enhance them all with specialized effects to inject professional sound design into the TR formula.\n\nThe TR-8S includes faithful recreations of the TR-808, TR-606, TR-909, TR-707, and TR-727, along with several modified versions. You also get the CR-78 CompuRhythm, a direct predecessor of the TR-808 that\u2019s left its own indelible footprint on pop classics from the 1980s and beyond. These are not sound-alike sample packs or mere recordings\u2014each is a complete machine built with detailed, down-to-the-circuit models that sound and behave exactly like the original hardware. All these sounds are yours, at your fingertips, and ready to use in your own productions and performances.\n\nThe FM sounds in the TR-8S are unlike anything this side of Mars, conjuring silvery drum hits and twisting tails to augment your tracks. Tap into the Morph parameter for a single, ultra-expressive macro control to sweep through an array of sonic variations, wildly manipulating FM depth, ratio, and feedback with simple knob movements. Or manually design six fully editable FM drum models, each with a unique parameter set for creating sounds sure to push sonic boundaries.\n\nToday\u2019s rhythm tracks need a diverse set of sounds and production techniques, and it\u2019s harder than ever to sound unique. While authentic TR and CR sounds are vital, layering your own mono or stereo samples, or pulling from the extensive onboard collection, opens a world of modern styles and the potential to craft your own signature sound. Like the ACB and FM sounds, you can deeply manipulate samples with hands-on control of tuning, decay, start points, speed, and direction. Create a kit entirely from samples. Or mix and match FM textures with classic Roland sounds for genre-defying drum tracks that demand attention.\n\nThe right effects make a drum part stand out by creating depth and space. Whether it\u2019s delay on a rimshot, overdrive on a kick, filters on toms and cymbals, or just the right amount of reverb on select instruments, the TR-8S has an array of percussion-tuned effects that sound great. In addition to the Master FX knob, each channel has a customizable CTRL knob, placing all this sound-shaping power within easy reach. The attack of the kick, snap of the snare, phaser depth, distortion amount\u2014whatever parameter you need direct access to\u2014can be assigned to the knobs and saved with the kit. Both Instrument and Master Effects, along with their precise settings, are also saved with each kit, so your productions are always performance ready.\n\nPattern creation on the TR-8S feels natural and intuitive, thanks to the Roland \u201dTR-REC\u201d step sequencer that\u2019s been the beating heart of electronic music production for decades. And now, it\u2019s been enhanced and modernized to be better than ever.\n\nYou can program on the 16 TR-REC buttons or use the velocity-sensitive performance pad to play live or record into the sequencer. And you can move seamlessly between either\u2014playing, editing, and reshaping your drum parts without ever interrupting your flow. Create intricate grooves and detailed fills using velocity, accents, flams, and adjustable sub steps for modern rolls and ratcheting. Get experimental with unusual polyrhythms and complex meters by adjusting the length or \"last step\" of each drum part.\n\nBring drum programming to life with a generous serving of probability. Set percentage values per step to instill your beat with evolving unpredictability\u2014simply hold a step and set the amount. Then adjust master probability to offset the overall effect or uncover hidden notes waiting to be revealed. For further flux, try the random kit or instrument functions to flip your sounds on the fly.\n\nKeep things fresh and exciting, even during extended live sets. The TR-8S can store 128 patterns, each with eight variations and three kinds of fills. Patterns or variations can be triggered individually or chained together for evolving sequences. Copy patterns on the fly during performances, and even stay ahead of the beat and work on patterns that aren\u2019t currently playing. Each pattern can include the tempo and the kit, along with its knob positions and effect settings. This gives you instant recall and enough flexibility to play an entire set without ever repeating a measure in the same way.\n\nWell-placed fills create thrilling moments in a track or a live set. Each pattern in the TR-8S can contain two fills that you can customize or create from scratch. There\u2019s also an adjustable \"Scatter\" fill to slice and dice a measure into short bursts of cool and controlled chaos. But at times, your hands may be too busy to trigger every fill manually. AUTO FILL IN automates fills every 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 measures, keeping your hands free and adding interesting dynamics to your performances.\n\nProfessional-sounding tracks require detailed production techniques. The TR-8S not only makes crafting this detail possible\u2014it makes it fast and fun. Locking parameters to steps or recording motion into patterns gives you everything from subtle movement to dramatic tonal shifts. Automate classic 808 basslines or go wild on snare pitch, panning, effects\u2026whatever you want. Motion recording is immediate and effortless, and motion playback can be instantly enabled or disabled.\n\nAfter the release of the TR-8, we listened to feedback from enthusiastic fans and artists from around the world\u2014and it left us with a clear vision to make it even better, both for studio production and live performance. We\u2019ve put these user-requested features\u2014and more\u2014into the TR-8S while keeping the immediacy and fun factor of the original TR-8 fully intact.\n\nLike some of its famous siblings, the TR-8S has eight separate analog outputs, so you can process individual drum sounds through external effects or send them into separate channels of your mixer or DAW. Take control of your sound and decide which instruments or groups are sent to which outputs. And whatever you choose, know that the TR-8S sounds big, punchy, and spacious thanks to its high-resolution 24-bit/96 kHz digital-to-analog converters.\n\nThe TR-8S has a dedicated trigger output as well as stereo audio inputs for external sources. And its assignable outputs can even be used as additional triggers. This lets you control external instruments and mix them with internal TR-8S sounds, greatly expanding your creative possibilities in the studio and performance possibilities on stage. Each pattern has a dedicated trigger track for access to all kinds of variations with no need to use up an instrument. Rimshots and triggered analog bass patterns? Yes, you can.\n\nAside from being the most powerful drum machine ever made, the TR-8S is a complete multi-channel audio and MIDI interface. When you connect the TR-8S to a computer or AIRA Link host, you can transfer MIDI and high-resolution audio over a single USB cable. Record each drum instrument to a different channel for individual processing and recording, automate parameter movements from your DAW by CC messages, or sync the TR-8S to your computer or Roland MX-1 Mix Performer for live sets or late-night jam sessions.\n\nEnhance your workflow with TR-EDITOR, a fluid computer-based editor and librarian for the TR-8S. Nimbly design and edit patterns and kits with the intuitive graphic interface, which features a wide array of onscreen parameters and access to deeper FM editing. And with the large display, it\u2019s easy to manage your entire library. Download TR-EDITOR for free today through Roland Cloud Manager, the software interface for Roland Cloud content.\nTR-EDITOR\n\nAesthetic and ergonomic improvements can be found throughout the TR-8S, giving it a timeless design that fits any creative space. The shape, colors, and overall feel have been refined to be more substantial, elegant, and inviting. RGB color faders and TR-REC buttons let you customize the brightness, glow, and color of each element. Not only does it look amazing, but it gives crucial visual feedback about what\u2019s playing, what\u2019s muted, which instruments are grouped, and so on. And then there\u2019s that lava lamp mode\u2026\n\nThe life of a musician can be pretty unpredictable, whether it\u2019s touring mishaps or studio calamities. Take comfort in the fact that every kit, every pattern, and every setting for literally everything can be backed up on an SD card. Just pop it into a fresh TR-8S and you\u2019re back up and running.\n\nThe TR-8S and TR-6S Rhythm Performers continue their sonic evolution with TR-8S v3.0 and TR-6S v2.0 updates.\n\nThe Roland TR-8S v2.0 Update adds a powerful FM sound engine that brings a whole universe of sonic textures to the modern drum machine classic.\n\nThis overview video introduces the new sound design and performance features in the TR-8S.\n\nThis video is Part 2 in an overview video series that takes a close look at the new Roland AIRA TR-8S Rhythm Performer.\n\nThis is the last video in a three-part overview video series that takes explores the new Roland AIRA TR-8S Rhythm Performer.\n\nBEC (Second State label) is a rising star in the Techno scene.
