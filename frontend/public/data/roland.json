      "description": "Take online gaming sound to the next level with BRIDGE CAST, your all-in-one solution for premium livestream audio. This customizable desktop hub is packed with secret weapons to take out the competition, including dual sound mixes, vocal transformer effects, music playback, sound effects, and support for a broadcast-grade mic and headphones. In the heat of the battle, BRIDGE CAST ensures that your audio is always as epic as your gameplay.\n\nThe companion BRIDGE CAST app takes your experience even further, allowing you to customize BRIDGE CAST audio features and enhance streams with royalty-free background music tracks and sound effects via BGM CAST and Roland Cloud.\n\nLearn how BRIDGE CAST's powerful audio tools will elevate your gaming streams with professional sound quality and easy real-time mixing control.\n\nBRIDGE CAST gives you what you need to deliver outstanding sound in every session, coupled with killer sonic tools to help you stand out from the crowd. Roland has been a leading innovator in electronic music and audio/video gear for over 50 years. With BRIDGE CAST on your desktop, you’ll be driving your sound with the brand trusted by generations of top creators worldwide.\n\nConnect BRIDGE CAST to your gaming computer via USB-C.\n\nPlug in a professional microphone to the XLR input.\n\nHook up your headphones.\n\nCustomize the audio and panel functions with the companion app.\n\nSet up personal and stream mixes with the hands-on controls.\n\nBRIDGE CAST lets you chat and interact using a broadcast-grade dynamic or condenser microphone, the foundation of any professional audio setup. The high-performance XLR mic preamp delivers clear, dynamic sound in the box, with no need for messy external add-ons. You get superior audio monitoring too, with a powerful headphone amplifier and high-sensitivity output for pro-quality phones. The versatile headphones connector also supports a headset mic for a quick, single-cable connection.\n\nWith the dual audio mixer in BRIDGE CAST, you can independently balance the mic level, team chats, gameplay sounds, and background music for you and your viewers. Give yourself a winning advantage with a personal mix that prioritizes what you need to hear while gaming. Then create a separate stream mix that’s perfectly balanced for maximum online engagement.\n\nAlong with a headphones output, BRIDGE CAST has a line output for external gaming speakers. Level knobs for each output let you easily control volumes and smoothly transition between phones and speakers during gameplay. There’s also a dedicated streaming level control to dial in the sound for your online audience.\n\nMorph your voice and become your character with fun processing derived from Roland’s famous VT voice transformer products. Adjust the pitch and formant to change your age or gender. Or go even further and take on the persona of a beast or alien.\n\nBRIDGE CAST also includes EQ, compression, and other pro vocal processing to level up your streams. A low-cut filter softens pesky “P” and “T” plosives, while the de-esser cleans up harsh “S” tones. There’s a noise suppressor to throttle background distractions, plus reverb to launch your voice into another dimension. And with the muscular hardware DSP handling the audio load, all your computer power is dedicated to gaming and streaming.\n\nImmerse yourself in 5.1 or 7.1 virtual surround sound for headphones and stereo speaker systems, powered by advanced Roland technology. Audio is converted from a PC to virtual surround sound via a USB connection, delivering a powerful and engaging sound experience.\n\nSlay your competition by highlighting important game sounds with Game EQ presets. Pinpoint audio frequencies and boost their levels to make it easier to hear critical elements, like enemy footsteps in first-person shooter games. You can even fine-tune while visually monitoring the analyzed waveform in real time. Once you find the ideal settings for different game titles, save them in onboard profiles and call them up with quick button presses while playing.\n\nBuilding your brand is an essential part of creating an online following. Choose your core BRIDGE CAST look with bold Black and Ice White finish options. And take it to another level by customizing the detachable faceplate using our downloadable skin template, which allows you to personalize the panel with your team or gamertag design. It’s also possible to customize the LED colors of the four control knobs for additional flair.\n\nThe ergonomic BRIDGE CAST panel lets you easily control your mix while staying focused on the game. Everything you need is at your fingers, including grab-and-go level knobs and assignable buttons for muting sounds and accessing various functions. The rock-solid design won’t move around on your desktop, and the discrete rear-panel connections keep clutter in check.\n\nThe powerful BRIDGE CAST app works in tandem with the hardware, giving you full access to an array of in-depth features. Dial in mic and audio parameters, configure Game EQ presets, and more. You can also re-assign hardware controls for your needs and save/recall custom BRIDGE CAST configurations for different games and streaming audiences.\n\nUsing the BRIDGE CAST app, effortlessly tailor your sound with intuitive microphone settings for speed and precision. The version 5.00 update allows you to adjust EQ with quick-access controls and use the studio-grade compressor to achieve a clean, professional vocal sound with a single fader. There's also an expander that minimizes unwanted background noise without unnatural artifacts.\n\nWith BGM CAST, adding background music and sonic color to streams has never been easier. Available through the BRIDGE CAST app and Roland Cloud, BGM CAST puts a growing selection of royalty-free background music and sound effects at your fingertips. Choose music by mood and genre or create playlists of your favorites for stress-free music management. You can also assign sound effects to the four hardware buttons for instant triggering.\n\nA free Roland Account provides 36 background music tracks and 16 sound effects to use at no charge. Signing up for Roland Cloud Core membership through the BRIDGE CAST app unlocks thousands of additional music tracks and hundreds of sound effects, with new selections added each month. Membership also includes powerful tools for modern music creators, including the ZENOLOGY synthesizer, Zenbeats production software, Sound Packs, and more.\n\nGet the BRIDGE CAST App\n\nIf you need a unified audio and video solution, be sure to check out BRIDGE CAST X.

An onboard selection of practice-friendly features is backed up by wireless connectivity to a tablet or smartphone, allowing audio playback and connectivity with the latest apps. Blending classic sounds with contemporary design, the Roland DP603 is perfect for the modern piano player.\n\n*The Bluetooth feature may not be available, depending on the country where the product is purchased.\n\nThe Roland DP603 stands apart from other models on the market. Slim and stylish, the linear cabinet design keeps curves and embellishments to a minimum. An integrated keyboard lid opens to provide an elegant music rest, and closes discreetly with a safety-conscious soft-fall motion. Despite its compact 35 cm (13.5-inch) depth, the DP603 offers the same acclaimed durability that the DP series has been famous for since 2003.\n\nStyle meets substance with the Roland DP603, which combines its minimalist look with heavyweight onboard tech that makes it a dream to play. This latest digital piano features the same sound engine as Roland’s flagship LX/HP models, and you’ll hear the benefits of our acclaimed SuperNATURAL Piano Modeling in performance that flawlessly recreates the rich, dynamic response of an acoustic instrument. You’ll also appreciate the new PHA-50 keyboard, whose blend of wood and molded material means it plays like traditional ivory, but without the associated maintenance and expense.\n\nThe DP603’s onboard speaker system projects warm, enveloping sound, with controllable volume that lets you play loudly or quietly to suit the scenario. This new piano goes even further to double as a wireless speaker system, so you won’t need to clutter your home with an additional hi-fi or stereo. Using Bluetooth wireless technology, simply connect the Roland DP603 with your smartphone or tablet, and then play back your favorite songs through the internal speakers. Or better still, jam along with them!\n\n*The Bluetooth feature may not be available depending on the country where you purchased this product.\n\nLearning the piano can be a solitary experience, but the Roland DP603 supports you every step of the way. With 300 onboard songs ready for you to jam over, you’ll be improving in no time. If you need it, the built-in metronome tightens up your timing before the onboard recorder assesses your development. USB playback/save functions enhance your practice sessions and let you archive performances, while Twin Piano mode enables a learner and teacher to sit side-by-side and play in the same key range. And don’t forget the teaching power of apps—by connecting with your iPad or Android tablet via Bluetooth MIDI or a USB cable, you can access a world of popular apps and online practice videos. A great first step is Roland’s Piano Partner 2, which displays the sheet music of the DP603’s internal songs on your tablet’s screen.\n\nInterested in learning piano but don’t know where to begin?

        "A Stylish Piano to Complement the Modern Home\n\nThe Roland DP603 stands apart from other models on the market. Slim and stylish, the linear cabinet design keeps curves and embellishments to a minimum. An integrated keyboard lid opens to provide an elegant music rest, and closes discreetly with a safety-conscious soft-fall motion. Despite its compact 35 cm (13.5-inch) depth, the DP603 offers the same acclaimed durability that the DP series has been famous for since 2003.",
        "Express Yourself with SuperNATURAL Piano Modeling and the Responsive PHA-50 Keyboard\n\nStyle meets substance with the Roland DP603, which combines its minimalist look with heavyweight onboard tech that makes it a dream to play. This latest digital piano features the same sound engine as Roland’s flagship LX/HP models, and you’ll hear the benefits of our acclaimed SuperNATURAL Piano Modeling in performance that flawlessly recreates the rich, dynamic response of an acoustic instrument. You’ll also appreciate the new PHA-50 keyboard, whose blend of wood and molded material means it plays like traditional ivory, but without the associated maintenance and expense.",
        "A Dynamic Speaker System Fills Your Home with Music\n\nThe DP603’s onboard speaker system projects warm, enveloping sound, with controllable volume that lets you play loudly or quietly to suit the scenario. This new piano goes even further to double as a wireless speaker system, so you won’t need to clutter your home with an additional hi-fi or stereo. Using Bluetooth wireless technology, simply connect the Roland DP603 with your smartphone or tablet, and then play back your favorite songs through the internal speakers. Or better still, jam along with them!\n\n*The Bluetooth feature may not be available depending on the country where you purchased this product.",
        "Learn Faster with Onboard Educational Tools and Wireless Connection to Piano Apps\n\nLearning the piano can be a solitary experience, but the Roland DP603 supports you every step of the way. With 300 onboard songs ready for you to jam over, you’ll be improving in no time. If you need it, the built-in metronome tightens up your timing before the onboard recorder assesses your development. USB playback/save functions enhance your practice sessions and let you archive performances, while Twin Piano mode enables a learner and teacher to sit side-by-side and play in the same key range. And don’t forget the teaching power of apps—by connecting with your iPad or Android tablet via Bluetooth MIDI or a USB cable, you can access a world of popular apps and online practice videos. A great first step is Roland’s Piano Partner 2, which displays the sheet music of the DP603’s internal songs on your tablet’s screen."
