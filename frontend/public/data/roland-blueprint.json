      "description": "Take online gaming sound to the next level with BRIDGE CAST, your all-in-one solution for premium livestream audio. This customizable desktop hub is packed with secret weapons to take out the competition, including dual sound mixes, vocal transformer effects, music playback, sound effects, and support for a broadcast-grade mic and headphones. In the heat of the battle, BRIDGE CAST ensures that your audio is always as epic as your gameplay. The companion BRIDGE CAST app takes your experience even further, allowing you to customize BRIDGE CAST audio features and enhance streams with royalty-free background music tracks and sound effects via BGM CAST and Roland Cloud. Learn how BRIDGE CAST's powerful audio tools will elevate your gaming streams with professional sound quality and easy real-time mixing control. BRIDGE CAST gives you what you need to deliver outstanding sound in every session, coupled with killer sonic tools to help you stand out from the crowd. Roland has been a leading innovator in electronic music and audio/video gear for over 50 years. With BRIDGE CAST on your desktop, you’ll be driving your sound with the brand trusted by generations of top creators worldwide. Connect BRIDGE CAST to your gaming computer via USB-C. Plug in a professional microphone to the XLR input. Hook up your headphones. Customize the audio and panel functions with the companion app. Set up personal and stream mixes with the hands-on controls. BRIDGE CAST lets you chat and interact using a broadcast-grade dynamic or condenser microphone, the foundation of any professional audio setup. The high-performance XLR mic preamp delivers clear, dynamic sound in the box, with no need for messy external add-ons. You get superior audio monitoring too, with a powerful headphone amplifier and high-sensitivity output for pro-quality phones. The versatile headphones connector also supports a headset mic for a quick, single-cable connection. With the dual audio mixer in BRIDGE CAST, you can independently balance the mic level, team chats, gameplay sounds, and background music for you and your viewers. Give yourself a winning advantage with a personal mix that prioritizes what you need to hear while gaming. Then create a separate stream mix that’s perfectly balanced for maximum online engagement. Along with a headphones output, BRIDGE CAST has a line output for external gaming speakers. Level knobs for each output let you easily control volumes and smoothly transition between phones and speakers during gameplay. There’s also a dedicated streaming level control to dial in the sound for your online audience. Morph your voice and become your character with fun processing derived from Roland’s famous VT voice transformer products. Adjust the pitch and formant to change your age or gender. Or go even further and take on the persona of a beast or alien. BRIDGE CAST also includes EQ, compression, and other pro vocal processing to level up your streams. A low-cut filter softens pesky “P” and “T” plosives, while the de-esser cleans up harsh “S” tones. There’s a noise suppressor to throttle background distractions, plus reverb to launch your voice into another dimension. And with the muscular hardware DSP handling the audio load, all your computer power is dedicated to gaming and streaming. Immerse yourself in 5.1 or 7.1 virtual surround sound for headphones and stereo speaker systems, powered by advanced Roland technology. Audio is converted from a PC to virtual surround sound via a USB connection, delivering a powerful and engaging sound experience. Slay your competition by highlighting important game sounds with Game EQ presets. Pinpoint audio frequencies and boost their levels to make it easier to hear critical elements, like enemy footsteps in first-person shooter games. You can even fine-tune while visually monitoring the analyzed waveform in real time. Once you find the ideal settings for different game titles, save them in onboard profiles and call them up with quick button presses while playing. Building your brand is an essential part of creating an online following. Choose your core BRIDGE CAST look with bold Black and Ice White finish options. And take it to another level by customizing the detachable faceplate using our downloadable skin template, which allows you to personalize the panel with your team or gamertag design. It’s also possible to customize the LED colors of the four control knobs for additional flair. The ergonomic BRIDGE CAST panel lets you easily control your mix while staying focused on the game. Everything you need is at your fingers, including grab-and-go level knobs and assignable buttons for muting sounds and accessing various functions. The rock-solid design won’t move around on your desktop, and the discrete rear-panel connections keep clutter in check. The powerful BRIDGE CAST app works in tandem with the hardware, giving you full access to an array of in-depth features. Dial in mic and audio parameters, configure Game EQ presets, and more. You can also re-assign hardware controls for your needs and save/recall custom BRIDGE CAST configurations for different games and streaming audiences. Using the BRIDGE CAST app, effortlessly tailor your sound with intuitive microphone settings for speed and precision. The version 5.00 update allows you to adjust EQ with quick-access controls and use the studio-grade compressor to achieve a clean, professional vocal sound with a single fader. There's also an expander that minimizes unwanted background noise without unnatural artifacts. With BGM CAST, adding background music and sonic color to streams has never been easier. Available through the BRIDGE CAST app and Roland Cloud, BGM CAST puts a growing selection of royalty-free background music and sound effects at your fingertips. Choose music by mood and genre or create playlists of your favorites for stress-free music management. You can also assign sound effects to the four hardware buttons for instant triggering. A free Roland Account provides 36 background music tracks and 16 sound effects to use at no charge. Signing up for Roland Cloud Core membership through the BRIDGE CAST app unlocks thousands of additional music tracks and hundreds of sound effects, with new selections added each month.

Connect a mic and sing with vocal effects and real-time harmonies. And go further with Bluetooth® audio/MIDI support, onboard recording, computer connectivity, and numerous expansion options on Roland Cloud. With its all-in-one mobile design, the FP-E50 lets you realize ambitious creative visions anywhere. And thanks to the intuitive interface, it’s easy to stay focused on what’s most important—making music. The attractive FP-E50 offers all the core features that have made the award-winning FP digital piano series so popular worldwide. It travels easily in and out of the home, while onboard stereo speakers project immersive sound everywhere you play. Connect to external speakers for more sound coverage if needed when performing. Or plug in headphones and keep the music all to yourself. While the FP-E50 is filled with advanced features, getting around on the instrument is frustration free. The top-level display shows sound, tempo, and other essential information, and the clean panel layout provides direct access to sound selection, favorite tones, keyboard transposition, and more.

The 88 full-size keys complete the experience, with hammer action, escapement, and Ivory Feel material providing the same touch beneath your fingers as a world-class acoustic instrument. The FP-E50 also features the expandable ZEN-Core sound engine, the same advanced sound generator used in professional Roland synthesizers like JUPITER-X and FANTOM. Explore historic Roland synth sounds, brass and orchestral voices, guitars and basses, world sounds, drums, and many others. Using simple controls, you can freely layer piano and ZEN-Core tones or assign different sounds to the left and right hands.

Drive arrangements with your left-hand fingering, from easy one-note triggering for beginners to full-chord detection for advanced players. Interactive mode makes things even more fun, letting you guide the volume and energy of the backing based on how you play. And with the Chord Sequencer function, you can improvise and develop melodies over colorful preset chord progressions that automatically follow the accompaniment. Sing along with keyboard performances using the FP-E50’s mic input and studio-grade vocal effects. Liven up the sound with rich ambience and tighten things up with the compressor and noise suppressor. Perform with impressive real-time harmonies that magically follow the chords you play. Or surprise audiences with voice transformer effects that change your gender or turn you into a funky robot. There’s even a vocoder for creating vintage electronic voices and choir sounds that you guide with notes on the keyboard. Take your FP-E50 experience further with Roland Cloud expansion, Bluetooth audio/MIDI support, onboard recording, and USB connectivity with music software on computers and mobile devices. On Roland Cloud, there’s an ever-expanding selection of FP-E50 content to discover.

After you’re satisfied, save your masterpiece to internal memory for on-demand playback or a USB flash drive for sharing. The FP-E50 also includes a USB audio/MIDI interface to develop your FP-E50 recordings further and compose new pieces in computer music production software.

      "description": "The GP-3 is the most compact and affordable grand in the acclaimed GP series, bringing you premium piano performance in a unique low-profile design that makes a statement in any living space. Roland’s modern features and benefits are infused throughout, from the organic piano sound engine and responsive hammer-action keyboard to onboard recording, Bluetooth® audio/MIDI connectivity, and deep integration with the Roland Piano App. If you’ve always wanted a grand piano but thought you didn’t have the space or budget to make it happen, the GP-3 turns your dream into reality. The GP-3 is a marvel to behold, fusing traditional grand piano luxury with a streamlined design that’s only possible with a modern digital instrument. With a front-to-back depth of just 638 mm/25-1/8 inches, it easily fits where larger pianos can’t. The striking black gloss finish, classic curves, and fine details convey sophistication and grace, while the slim cabinet projects a commanding presence that belies its modest footprint. Embedded inside the GP-3’s elegant exterior is a complex piano ecosystem born of decades of Roland development. With our advanced Piano Reality approach, every element works together to deliver a complete piano experience, from the sound engine, keyboard, and pedals to the custom speaker system. And with easy volume control, mobile device connectivity, and other digital benefits, the GP-3 is a perfect fit for today’s lifestyles. The Piano Reality Standard sound engine authentically reproduces the living response and complex tonal colors of a genuine acoustic grand. That’s supported by the PHA-4 Standard keyboard with progressive hammer action, escapement, Ivory Feel material, and accelerated key sensing technology, putting the same touch beneath your fingers as a concert-grade acoustic instrument. Sustain, soft, and sostenuto pedals round out the grand experience, with true weighted feel and detection for traditional half-pedal techniques. The GP-3 features an integrated stereo speaker system specially tuned for top-quality sound and maximum projection from the low-profile cabinet design. Powerful amplification and advanced sonic processing deliver an immersive, room-filling piano experience for the player and listeners. You can even adjust the overall tone color by opening the lid—just like an acoustic grand. With onboard Bluetooth, it’s easy to elevate your piano enjoyment with mobile devices. Stream songs from your music library through the piano’s speaker system to play along or provide background when relaxing or entertaining. Or use Bluetooth MIDI with music production apps to wirelessly compose using the GP-3’s responsive weighted keyboard. USB ports are also available for connecting with computers and flash storage devices, providing more ways to explore your creativity and share music performances. The Roland Piano App seamlessly extends the GP-3 experience with remote operation from your smartphone or tablet. Select sounds, control the metronome, and use the recording feature to evaluate your playing and hear where you need to improve. Browse the piano’s onboard song library and call up digital scores to learn them at your own pace. And motivate yourself with lesson features that include an activity log with goals, flash card games, rhythm exercises, and a One Week Master program that guides you through learning different piano pieces. With its digital heart, the GP-3 brings you a world of advantages over a traditional acoustic piano. Volume control is within easy reach, and you can connect headphones to play anytime without disturbing others. Twin Piano mode enables you to play alongside a family member, friend, or teacher. And with no need for tuning and regular maintenance, the GP-3 will always sound as perfect as the day you bring it home. From living spaces large and small to performance venues and commercial establishments, there’s a GP model to meet every need. Mid-line GP model with an elegant baby grand cabinet and our advanced Piano Reality Modeling approach. Roland’s premier grand piano features a large, luxurious cabinet and our advanced Piano Reality Modeling approach for the ultimate musical experience. The GP-9 model expanded with features for performance venues, hotels, and restaurants, including moving keys, professional audio outputs, and a microphone input. Roland engineers from across multiple disciplines shed light on this groundbreaking new approach to piano sonics.Read more… Interested in learning piano but don’t know where to begin?

      "description": "The mid-level GP-6 offers premium GP features in a luxurious baby grand cabinet that brings a sense of sophistication to every space. Elegant curves and finely crafted details deliver the unmistakable presence of a fine acoustic grand, while the advanced technologies inside deliver the touch, tone, and sound projection to match. You also get a world of modern benefits that flow with today’s lifestyles, including low-maintenance operation, onboard learning tools, Bluetooth® connectivity, and much more. With its striking design and flowing curves, the GP-6 brings you majestic piano luxury in a reduced footprint compared to a larger grand piano. And while the size may be streamlined, you still get the no-compromise performance of a full-scale instrument. Like an acoustic grand, there’s a top lid that opens for broader sound projection and a retractable cover to protect the keys when not in use. Minimalist touch buttons disappear into the panel when the backlighting is turned off, allowing you to maintain the acoustic aesthetic and eliminate distractions while playing. Piano bench may vary by region. The GP-6 is built around advanced Roland’s Piano Reality approach, a sophisticated ecosystem of connected technologies comprising the sound engine, keyboard, pedals, audio components, and speakers. Each section is designed to work together flawlessly and transparently, allowing players to experience the purity of this wonderful instrument with unprecedented expression and realism. Piano Reality Modeling leverages our latest technologies to recreate every sound-making element of an acoustic piano, putting the living response and complex tonal colors of a concert-class grand under your fingers. And with unlimited polyphony, notes and resonances ring in full detail to translate every musical emotion. The PHA-50 Hybrid keyboard connects you with the deep musical expression available in the powerful sound engine. Progressive hammer action with escapement provides genuine grand piano touch, coupled with advanced acceleration sensing technology for accurate detection of the subtlest playing nuances. Hybrid wood/molded keys with Ivory Feel materials offer natural balance and rugged durability for years of trouble-free use. High-performance sustain, soft, and sostenuto pedals complete the experience with weighted feel, damper modeling, and support for traditional pedal techniques. The GP-6 projects a big acoustic voice from its baby grand cabinet, thanks to the Piano Reality Projection sound system. Five speakers, discrete amplification, superior audio circuitry, and advanced sonic processing come together to envelop the space around the instrument with immersive and inspiring tones. The GP-6 offers several world-class grand piano sounds that are ready to enjoy. But if you’re an experienced player, you can dive into the onboard Piano Designer tools to further refine the tone and response for your personal touch. Adjust the string tuning and temperament, fine-tune keyboard sensitivity and duplex scaling, shape cabinet resonances, and much more. With built-in Bluetooth, you can use your favorite mobile devices with the GP-6. Stream songs from your music library through the piano’s speaker system to play along or provide background when relaxing or entertaining. Or use Bluetooth MIDI with music production apps to wirelessly compose using the GP-6’s responsive weighted keyboard. USB ports are also available for connecting with computers and flash storage devices, providing more ways to explore your creativity and share music performances. The Roland Piano App seamlessly extends the GP-6 experience with remote operation from your smartphone or tablet. Select sounds, control the metronome, and use the recording feature to evaluate your playing and hear where you need to improve. Browse the piano’s onboard songs and a growing range of selections on Roland Cloud, and then call up digital scores to learn them at your own pace. And motivate yourself with lesson features that include an activity log with goals, flash card games, rhythm exercises, and a One Week Master program that guides you through learning different piano pieces. Greatly reduced weight makes the GP-6 far easier to move than any acoustic grand, and there’s no need for professional tuning or other regular maintenance. Volume control is within easy reach, and you can connect headphones to play anytime without disturbing others. The onboard metronome and simple rhythms help develop your sense of timing during daily practice sessions. And with Twin Piano mode, you can split the keyboard into two independent sections and play alongside a family member, friend, or teacher. From living spaces large and small to performance venues and commercial establishments, there’s a GP model to meet every need. Low-profile grand piano with a unique space-saving footprint and our Piano Reality Standard sound engine. Roland’s premier grand piano features a large, luxurious cabinet and our advanced Piano Reality Modeling approach for the ultimate musical experience. The GP-9 model expanded with features for performance venues, hotels, and restaurants, including moving keys, professional audio outputs, and a microphone input. In this performance video, hear the complex tonal colors from this concert-class grand piano.

      "description": "The GP-9 brings you Roland’s premier piano experience, offering refined musical expression in a sophisticated and luxurious instrument that makes a majestic statement in any space. Elegant curves and finely crafted details project the bold look of a world-class acoustic grand, while the advanced technologies inside deliver the touch, tone, and sound projection to match. You also get a world of modern benefits that flow with today’s lifestyles, including low-maintenance operation, onboard learning tools, Bluetooth® connectivity, and much more. The GP-9 embodies signature piano elegance with its flowing curves, solid lines, and striking high-gloss ebony and polished white finishes. Like an acoustic grand, the lid can be opened to different positions to adjust the sound character or closed to create a flat surface when not in use. Smart touch controls in the panel provide intuitive access to essential functions as needed. And when you’re ready to play, you can turn off their backlighting to eliminate distractions and maintain the acoustic aesthetic. The GP-9 is built around advanced Roland’s Piano Reality approach, a sophisticated ecosystem of connected technologies comprising the sound engine, keyboard, pedals, audio components, and speakers. Each section is designed to work together flawlessly and transparently, allowing players to experience the purity of this wonderful instrument with unprecedented expression and realism. Piano Reality Modeling leverages our latest technologies to recreate every sound-making element of an acoustic piano, putting the living response and complex tonal colors of a concert-class grand under your fingers. Modeled ambience is integrated into the sound engine, allowing you to play in realistic spaces such as an intimate studio, spacious concert hall, or large cathedral. And with unlimited polyphony, notes and resonances ring in full detail to translate every musical emotion. The Hybrid Grand keyboard provides unbounded expression with progressive hammer action, escapement, hybrid wood/molded key construction with Ivory Feel, and advanced acceleration sensing technology for accurate detection of the subtlest playing nuances. Fine details further elevate the feel, including long key pivot length and haptic vibration that emulates the subtle vibrations from an acoustic piano’s body. High-performance sustain, soft, and sostenuto pedals round out the authentic experience, offering weighted feel, damper modeling, and support for traditional pedal techniques. The GP-9 features the Piano Reality Projection sound system, where multi-channel amplification, premium audio circuitry, and advanced sonic processing come together for the ultimate full-surround piano experience. The cabinet construction, speaker placement, and lid angle have all been carefully tuned to deliver the same bold and immersive sound presentation as a concert grand in a performance hall. And notes naturally move across the immediate sound field as you play, mirroring the physical string positions on an acoustic grand’s soundboard. The GP-9 offers several world-class grand piano sounds that are ready to enjoy. But if you’re an experienced player, you can dive into the onboard Piano Designer tools to further refine the tone and response for your personal touch. Adjust the string tuning and temperament, fine-tune keyboard sensitivity and duplex scaling, shape cabinet resonances, and much more. With onboard Bluetooth, you can use your favorite mobile devices with the GP-9. Stream songs from your music library through the piano’s speaker system to play along or provide background when relaxing or entertaining. Or use Bluetooth MIDI with music production apps to wirelessly compose using the GP-9’s responsive weighted keyboard. USB ports are also available for connecting with computers and flash storage devices, providing more ways to explore your creativity and share music performances. The Roland Piano App seamlessly extends the GP-9 experience with remote operation from your smartphone or tablet. Select sounds, control the metronome, and use the recording feature to evaluate your playing and hear where you need to improve. Browse the piano’s onboard songs and a growing range of selections on Roland Cloud, and then call up digital scores to learn them at your own pace. And motivate yourself with lesson features that include an activity log with goals, flash card games, rhythm exercises, and a One Week Master program that guides you through learning different piano pieces. Greatly reduced weight (169.0 kg/372.6 lb.) makes the GP-9 far easier to move than any acoustic grand, and there’s no need for professional tuning or other regular maintenance. Volume control is within easy reach, and you can connect headphones to play anytime without disturbing others. The onboard metronome and simple rhythms help develop your sense of timing during daily practice sessions. And with Twin Piano mode, you can split the keyboard into two independent sections and play alongside a family member, friend, or teacher. The top-line GP-9M model features a moving key function for entertaining at home gatherings and commercial venues like restaurants and hotels. Call up songs from the piano’s extensive onboard library or MIDI files via USB flash media, and then watch and listen as the keys magically play themselves. View GP-9M From living spaces large and small to performance venues and commercial establishments, there’s a GP model to meet every need. Low-profile grand piano with a unique space-saving footprint and our Piano Reality Standard sound engine. Mid-line GP model with an elegant baby grand cabinet and our advanced Piano Reality Modeling approach.

      "description": "The GP-9M brings you Roland’s premier piano experience, offering refined musical expression in a sophisticated and luxurious instrument that makes a majestic statement in any space. This impressive piano includes the same flagship sound and features as its sister model, the GP-9, while adding moving keys, professional audio outputs, and a microphone input for singing along through the onboard speaker system. This makes the GP-9M ideal for performance venues, commercial establishments, and homeowners looking for the ultimate piano entertainment showcase. The GP-9M embodies signature piano elegance with its flowing curves, solid lines, and striking high-gloss ebony and polished white finishes. Like an acoustic grand, the lid can be opened to different positions to adjust the sound character or closed to create a flat surface when not in use. Smart touch controls in the panel provide intuitive access to essential functions as needed. And when you’re ready to play, you can turn off their backlighting to eliminate distractions and maintain the acoustic aesthetic. The GP-9M features a moving key function for entertaining at home gatherings and commercial venues like restaurants and hotels. Call up songs from the piano’s extensive onboard library or MIDI files via USB flash media, and then watch and listen as the keys magically play themselves. Roland Cloud also offers a growing library of songs that can be accessed via the Roland Piano App. Professional XLR outputs enable you to connect the piano directly to a house audio system in a performance venue or commercial establishment for broader sound coverage and independent control from the onboard speakers. All GP-9M sounds go to the outputs by default, but you can assign the dry piano sound, ambience only, or song playback to suit your needs. There’s a dedicated microphone input as well, allowing a performer to sing through the GP-9M’s sound system without the need for an external preamp or audio mixer. The GP-9M is built around advanced Roland’s Piano Reality approach, a sophisticated ecosystem of connected technologies comprising the sound engine, keyboard, pedals, audio components, and speakers. Each section is designed to work together flawlessly and transparently, allowing players to experience the purity of this wonderful instrument with unprecedented expression and realism. Piano Reality Modeling leverages our latest technologies to recreate every sound-making element of an acoustic piano, putting the living response and complex tonal colors of a concert-class grand under your fingers. Modeled ambience is integrated into the sound engine, allowing you to play in realistic spaces such as an intimate studio, spacious concert hall, or large cathedral. And with unlimited polyphony, notes and resonances ring in full detail to translate every musical emotion. The Hybrid Grand keyboard provides unbounded expression with progressive hammer action, escapement, hybrid wood/molded key construction with Ivory Feel, and advanced acceleration sensing technology for accurate detection of the subtlest playing nuances. Fine details further elevate the feel, including long key pivot length and haptic vibration that emulates the subtle vibrations from an acoustic piano’s body. High-performance sustain, soft, and sostenuto pedals round out the authentic experience, offering weighted feel, damper modeling, and support for traditional pedal techniques. The GP-9M features the Piano Reality Projection sound system, where multi-channel amplification, premium audio circuitry, and advanced sonic processing come together for the ultimate full-surround piano experience. The cabinet construction, speaker placement, and lid angle have all been carefully tuned to deliver the same bold and immersive sound presentation as a concert grand in a performance hall. And notes naturally move across the immediate sound field as you play, mirroring the physical string positions on an acoustic grand’s soundboard. The GP-9M offers several world-class grand piano sounds that are ready to enjoy. But if you’re an experienced player, you can dive into the onboard Piano Designer tools to further refine the tone and response for your personal touch. Adjust the string tuning and temperament, fine-tune keyboard sensitivity and duplex scaling, shape cabinet resonances, and much more. Customized settings can be recalled with a touch, a great feature for different pianists who play the GP-9M in a commercial environment or performance venue. With onboard Bluetooth, you can use your favorite mobile devices with the GP-9M. Stream songs from your music library through the piano’s speaker system to play along or provide background when relaxing or entertaining. Or use Bluetooth MIDI with music production apps to wirelessly compose using the GP-9M’s responsive weighted keyboard. USB ports are also available for connecting with computers and flash storage devices, providing more ways to explore your creativity and share music performances. The Roland Piano App seamlessly extends the GP-9M experience with remote operation from your smartphone or tablet. Select sounds, control the metronome, and use the recording feature to evaluate your playing and hear where you need to improve. Browse the piano’s onboard songs and selections on Roland Cloud, and then call up digital scores to learn them at your own pace. And motivate yourself with lesson features that include an activity log with goals, flash card games, rhythm exercises, and a One Week Master program that guides you through learning different piano pieces. Acoustic grand pianos are extremely heavy, difficult to move, and require professional tuning and other regular maintenance to keep them sounding their best. Thanks to their digital sound engines, GP pianos weigh drastically less than their acoustic counterparts. And they’re always perfectly in tune, producing outstanding sound every time you power on. Volume control is within easy reach, and you can connect headphones to play anytime without disturbing others. The onboard metronome and simple rhythms help develop your sense of timing during daily practice sessions. And with Twin Piano mode, you can split the keyboard into two independent sections and play alongside a family member, friend, or teacher. From living spaces large and small to performance venues and commercial establishments, there’s a GP model to meet every need. Low-profile grand piano with a unique space-saving footprint and our Piano Reality Standard sound engine. Mid-line GP model with an elegant baby grand cabinet and our advanced Piano Reality Modeling approach. Roland’s premier grand piano features a large, luxurious cabinet and our advanced Piano Reality Modeling approach for the ultimate musical experience. Roland engineers from across multiple disciplines shed light on this groundbreaking new approach to piano sonics.Read more… Interested in learning piano but don’t know where to begin?

      "description": "Playing the piano is one of life’s most rewarding experiences, whether teaching yourself or watching your family discover a passion for music. Roland’s HP700 series supports your ambitions with gorgeous piano sound, sophisticated styling, and helpful features that’ll keep you coming back for more. And with the flexibility and expression to suit any genre or playing standard, you’ll have an instrument that grows with you. Whatever your reasons for owning a piano, the HP700 series can help fulfill them—bringing style, culture, and music into the heart of your home. An HP700 piano can be the centerpiece of a room—or so discreet you hardly know it’s there. For silent practice day or night, connect headphones and enjoy immersive sound that won’t disturb your family or neighbors. For interactive study, wirelessly connect the piano with your smartphone via Bluetooth® and play along with your favorite tunes or sharpen your skills with online tutorials. For performance, adjust the volume-controllable internal speakers to fill the room with music. And when you’re not playing, you can use the HP700 piano as your home entertainment system, streaming music with clear, detailed highs and rich, powerful lows. The Headphones 3D Ambience feature makes your playing sound like it’s coming from the heart of the piano, providing a rich, immersive experience for your private music sessions. With built-in Bluetooth wireless audio support, you can stream music from your smartphone through the piano’s powerful internal speakers—perfect for social gatherings and practice sessions. Practice sessions are fun and productive when you play along with the vast selection of onboard tunes. Choose from classical, pop, and jazz pieces, complete with full orchestral accompaniment. Studying piano doesn’t have to mean endless work. Just five minutes of focused daily practice can improve your playing—especially with the Roland Piano App. It runs on your smartphone or tablet and communicates with the piano via Bluetooth, so it’s always ready for action. Find your favorite tunes, play along, and record your performance or practice session. Then listen back to assess the areas that need attention, even when you’re away from the piano. It’s the fast-track route to better playing and way more enjoyable than just practicing over and over. The One Week Master program guides you through learning a piece of music in just seven days. Choose from the large variety of folk, jazz, and classical pieces in your HP700 series piano, and then start the challenge. From the app, you can browse the piano’s song library, listen to selections, and call up sheet music to learn them yourself. Slow the tempo to go at your own pace and mute the left- or right-hand part as needed to focus on each hand individually. The app’s Timeline feature logs each practice session with your HP700 piano, making it easy to keep track of how often you’re playing. Staying inspired is the key to enjoying any musical instrument, and the HP700 series gives you the touch, tone, and features to explore a variety of musical genres and playing styles. The responsive keyboard and powerful sound engine deliver authentic piano performance, supporting you during first steps right through to developing professional techniques. Unlike most digital pianos, the HP700 series features SuperNATURAL Piano Modeling, an advanced technology that reproduces the complex physical interactions that occur when an acoustic piano creates sound. You’ll hear—and feel—the difference in every note you play. The Hybrid Keyboard combines the beautiful look and familiar feel of a wooden keyboard with the durability of modern molded materials, eliminating regular maintenance costs. The Progressive Damper Action pedal accurately replicates the damper pedal behavior of an acoustic piano, enabling traditional techniques like half-pedaling, As a parent, nothing beats watching your child discover a creative new hobby. When you choose the right piano, you’ll give them a passion for life and help them to appreciate music while teaching them how to overcome challenges and achieve goals. Find out why the HP700 series is the perfect first step on their musical journey. Make a bold statement—or keep things subtle. Taking inspiration from the elegant and curvaceous cabinets of traditional pianos—with a modern twist—the HP series brings sophistication to any home or décor. Plus, with compact dimensions, a smaller footprint, and lighter weight than a traditional acoustic, you can move your HP700 piano around until you find the perfect spot. Timeless and elegant cabinet designs that satisfy modern tastes. With the control panel concealed beneath the keyboard lid, each HP piano has a streamlined look that won’t distract you during a performance. Backed by Roland’s advanced sound technology, the onboard speakers deliver dynamic, full-range sound during practice, performance, or parties. Children thrive when learning a musical instrument, and choosing the right one helps spark their passion and keeps them playing. With expressive tones that bring the music to life and a responsive keyboard at their fingertips, an HP700 series piano ensures they stay inspired and keen to improve—especially when they hook up the piano to their smartphone and play along to their favorite music. Introducing the Roland HP700 series: pianos to inspire your child’s creativity. Between school, clubs, and homework, kids lead hectic lives—which makes it tough to find time for piano practice. While playing an acoustic piano can disturb others, the HP700 series lets your children either reduce the volume or plug in headphones and concentrate on learning piano while family life goes on around them. It’s the flexible solution that lets them play any time they like. Open the lid and the piano is ready to play—no need to press the power button. The controls are directly in the line of sight, so kids can glance down, find what they need, and focus on their practice. The HP704’s music rest is also angle-adjustable to match your child’s sitting height, letting them get comfortable and dive into the music. Headphones are especially useful for young musicians, letting them practice at any time of the day or night. Thanks to the Headphones 3D ambience feature, they’ll experience the immersive acoustic effect of playing in a real concert hall without disturbing anyone else. And with the volume limit function, you can set the maximum volume of the phones or onboard speakers to ensure their hearing is always protected. The Roland Piano App can track your child’s daily playing, giving you instant updates on their progress. It’s a great way to bond with your child over their new hobby while taking part in their musical journey and encouraging them to keep going. Timeline lets you check the tunes your child has played and view how long they’ve practiced. And with the recording function, you can listen back to their performance using your smartphone or tablet. It’s great for young musicians to have targets, and the One Week Master program helps your child learn a piece of music in just seven days. With the HP700’s song collection spanning many genres, they’re sure to find something that inspires them, while you follow their progress using the app. For your child to improve, it’s important that they practice between piano lessons. And with the HP700 series, that doesn’t have to mean boring exercises. With a variety of built-in tutorial features, the HP700 series makes learning so much fun that you’ll never have to persuade your child to practice. The Do Re Mi lesson feature substitutes the usual piano notes with spoken phrases (do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do), allowing your child to learn scales by singing along with the onboard tunes. To make it even easier and more fun, use the Roland Piano App to display the digital music score on your smartphone or tablet. In addition, learning to play in time to a beat is the first step towards your child performing music with others, and the HP700’s built-in metronome provides an essential tool to help develop their sense of rhythm. When your child sits alongside you—or their piano teacher—you can divide the keyboard into left and right areas, so that two people can play in the same note ranges. It’s a great tutorial aid that makes it easy for your child to copy what you demonstrate. It also provides a convenient way for two children to practice at the same time. When your child finds the musical genre that sparks their passion, practice sessions become a pleasure. Each HP700 piano contains over 380 songs ranging from classical and pop to jazz, with arrangements and skill levels to match their playing standard. Let your child discover tunes from popular modern genres or sharpen their classical skills with 287 piano études from legends like Charles-Louis Hanon, complete with full orchestral accompaniment. Along with its powerful education tools, the Roland Piano App provides access to interactive scores for the HP700’s song library. It’s frustrating to invest in an entry-level piano only to realize that its feel and tone are holding your child back. But with the HP700 series, they’ll be supported along every step of their musical journey. Authentic tones and a welcoming feel provide first-timers with great sound and the inspiration to keep going. And as their skills develop, these pianos really keep up. When you choose the HP700 series, you’re choosing an instrument that will last. The HP704 provides the style, performance, and pristine sound projection you’d expect from a premium studio piano. With its sleek, sophisticated cabinet design, this digital piano makes a statement wherever you play it—and a range of finishes ensures it fits in anywhere. The advanced PHA-50 keyboard, onboard tutorial features, and Bluetooth connectivity with music apps mean you’ll always be inspired to play, explore and improve. And the tall, elegant cabinet houses a powerful four-speaker audio system that delivers dynamic, room-filling sound as you perform—or while you relax by streaming your favorite tunes.

With GALAXIAS, you can now explore and experience them all in one creative environment. From historic icons such as the JUPITER-8, TR-808, and D-50 to modern instruments like ZENOLOGY GX and SYSTEM-8, GALAXIAS harnesses Roland’s evolving sonic legacy within a single intuitive workflow. Choose from your favorite Roland synths and drum machines, search specific sound types, or mine the ever-expanding collection of over 25,000 sounds to spark new ideas and build compelling tracks. GALAXIAS puts unlimited albums’ worth of inspiration at your command—from vintage sounds to futuristic hybrid tones—with more added each month. GALAXIAS lets you layer up to four instruments to create massive sonic superclusters called Scenes. Build an intricate setup of your favorite Roland instruments, such as a full stack of JUPITER and JUNO synths, or multiple eras of TR drum machines locked in perfect sync. Dial in an arpeggiator pattern (or four), quickly define key ranges and macro controls, and then play the whole thing as a single instrument in the studio or on stage. Seamlessly integrated into GALAXIAS, ZENOLOGY GX delivers over 11,000 genre-defining Roland sounds in one powerful instrument. Layer up to four instances with definable key ranges, sophisticated macro controls, per-layer effects, and creative tools like ARPS and CHORDS. Explore the vast collection of presets or craft your own using 23 authentic oscillator and filter models, over 7,000 PCM waveforms, 11 LFO shapes—including a versatile Step LFO for rhythmic movement—and 90+ effects. From studio to stage, ZENOLOGY GX puts limitless sonic potential at your fingertips. Every layer in GALAXIAS has its own key range, transpose, and MIDI input settings. The convenient learn and drag functionality makes it fast and easy to build intricate, layered sounds that are deeply engaging and demand attention. Experience a new level of expression and playability with the ultra-powerful macro controls in GALAXIAS. Easily assign any instrument, effect, or mix parameter to the 16 color-coded knobs and link them to a MIDI controller for real-time operation. Control multiple parameters at once and manipulate them by hand or via tempo-synced LFOs. And with the Smart Link function, you can define parameter ranges and inversions with one simple action. In addition to the formidable effects within each individual instrument, GALAXIAS gives you two insert effects per layer and two global send effects. Choose from the growing collection of authentic Roland and BOSS effects and take your sounds to new frontiers. You can also route layers to external outputs or channels in your DAW for further processing. Glistening arp patterns, thundering bass lines, and emotive chord progressions are only a few clicks away. Along with the onboard pattern sequencers in many of the individual instruments, GALAXIAS provides a powerful arpeggiator and dynamic chord sequencer on each layer. This feature will grow with more sequencer options and other creative tools in future updates. The inspiring GALAXIAS interface has been carefully forged for rapid creativity and instant satisfaction. You don’t need a manual to get going, and it’s easy to go deep to quickly translate your ideas into great-sounding tracks. In fact, GALAXIAS may well be your starting point in every creative session and, paired with your favorite DAW, can take your music to unexplored territory. While GALAXIAS can run as a standalone instrument, it also works as a multichannel plug-in for browsing, playing, and recording directly in your DAW. Arpeggiators, pattern sequencers, and LFOs sync with the master tempo, and you can even drag and drop MIDI and audio directly to tracks with some instruments. And with the future GALAXIAS roadmap, that’s only the beginning. Delve into a single instrument layer, go deep into the full set of parameters, and get the experience of using the original hardware. With the full-screen Immersive Mode, you can toggle your focus between the entire Scene and an individual instrument or effect using a single click or key command. Open GALAXIAS and you’ll find it bursting with instruments, sounds, effects, and creative tools to inspire your music.

      "description": "Released in 1981, the JUPITER-8 is one of the most revered and sought-after polysynths of all time. It appears on countless hit tracks spanning decades, and its lush analog sound is simply unmatched for warm pads, soaring strings, and infectious lead tones. With the JUPITER-8 Software Synthesizer, you get an authentic, down-to-the-circuit-level recreation of this vintage icon for your DAW or SYSTEM-8. + Highlights The JUPITER-8 is perhaps the most desirable analog polysynth ever, with original units going for extremely high prices on the used market. It represents the pinnacle of Roland engineering in the early 1980s, with a gorgeous design, robust build, and extreme sonic flexibility. The instrument’s incredibly warm-yet-clear sound is forever imprinted on the many essential music genres that emerged during its original release. And its influence has never diminished, appearing across a range of styles to this day. Aside from its iconic good looks and roadworthy build, the JUPITER-8 is famous for its unmistakable sound. Each of its eight voices had two stable VCOs with four waveforms to choose from, plus support for cross-modulation and screaming sync sounds. The creamy filter is renowned among synth aficionados with its selectable two- or four-pole low-pass VCF and non-resonant high-pass filter. Add in two envelopes, an onboard arpeggiator, and generous modulation capabilities, and you have the makings of a true legend. We’ve used our proprietary circuit modeling technology to bring the JUPITER-8 to life in your DAW or SYSTEM-8. The ACB process involves carefully analyzing original hardware units, circuit diagrams, and other historical data. We then use this information to recreate the authentic circuit behaviors of the vintage instrument, including all the beloved quirks and instabilities. This is what gives the JUPITER-8 Software Synthesizer its breathtakingly lifelike sound and unique character. While developing the JUPITER-8 plug-in, we felt it was important not to veer too far from the original’s classic workflow and sonic majesty. But we couldn’t resist adding a few modern touches like making it velocity sensitive, extending the oscillator range, adding an effects section, and enhancing the onboard arpeggiator for extra flexibility. The LFO, arpeggiator, and effects conveniently sync to tempo, and the plug-in fits perfectly into your production environment with a freely resizable, high-definition UI and support for VST3, AAX, and AU formats. Vintage synths like the JUPITER-8 had internal trim controls that allowed technicians to tweak various analog components when they drifted out of spec. But sometimes, “out of spec” created a sound that was unique, interesting, or extraordinary. Realized through our latest ACB advancements, the newly added Circuit Mod function lets you sweep through multiple trims using a single macro control. Along with the Condition parameter, which simulates the effects of aging, you can dial in everything from a factory-primed JUPITER-8 to a road-worn synth that hasn’t seen a tech bench in decades. The sophisticated browser lets you explore the JUPITER-8’s stunning collection of factory presets, your own custom sounds, and patches downloaded from Roland Cloud. Search across all installed patch banks, sort results, rate your favorites, jot down notes, and make quick adjustments with the integrated tweak panel. The JUPITER-8 Software Synthesizer offers full integration with the SYSTEM-8 keyboard. You can change the JUPITER-8’s plug-in panel to match the SYSTEM-8 for intuitive, one-to-one control. Or use the PLUG-OUT functionality to turn your SYSTEM-8 into a standalone JUPITER-8 that you can play in the studio or on stage. The JUPITER-8 Software Synthesizer is available with Roland Cloud Pro (via Pro Selector) and Ultimate memberships or a Lifetime Key purchase. Roland Cloud is also home to software versions of other vintage Roland instruments plus ZENOLOGY, ZENOLOGY FX, Zenbeats, and other inspiring music tools to back your creative journeys.

      "description": "THE SOUND THAT GAVE BIRTH TO A MOVEMENT With an unmistakable sonic signature brimming with warmth, energy, and character, the Roland TB-303 Bass Line defined the acid house movement of the late 1980s. Widely misunderstood when launched in 1981, the true revolution began several years later when electronic music producers rediscovered the quirky box, unleashing the hypnotic, liquid sound that captivated a generation. The TB-303 Software Bass Line delivers this historic instrument in a DAW plug-in, with circuit-level sonic accuracy and useful modern enhancements. 303 DAY: DJ Pierre and the Roland TB-303 Some instruments are so groundbreaking they create entire musical genres. The TB-303 is one of these influential instruments, but it wasn’t always seen that way. When Roland released the TB-303 in 1981, it was marketed as a computerized bass machine to simulate a traditional bass guitar, but didn’t quite catch on. Later on, inventive electronic musicians discovered the 303, often on the secondhand market, and found new uses for its recognizably fluid low end. Using the 303 in new ways, DJ Pierre and Phuture pioneered what came to be known as acid. This new sound ignited other electronic music genres and, like the Roland TR-808’s influence on hip-hop, the TB-303 played an essential role in late ‘80s-early ‘90s rave culture. While we may never really understand why the 303 sound makes people want to dance, there’s no denying its power, influence, and unwavering ability to get a party started. The TB-303 Software Synthesizer takes the classic instrument to the next level. Utilizing Analog Circuit Behavior modeling the virtual TB-303 captures the hypnotic tone of the original hardware and forms the perfect complement to the TR-909 and other classic Roland instruments. The iconic interface and signature crunch and squelch of the original are perfectly reproduced, while adding new features which surely would have turned heads back in the day: The 303’s new editing window is one of the most striking features. For the first time, you can create and edit patterns with a visual interface. With the ability to see the DNA of a preset pattern, you can edit a variation, or start from scratch then step-edit a new pattern, using up to six octaves with user-defined scales, accents, slides, pitch manipulation, and more. The new randomize/generate functions create an endless supply of classic 303 patterns. With five new play modes (Forward/Reverse/FWD&REV/Invert/Random) the TB-303 Software Synthesizer widens the ability to experiment. These new functions allow sonic alchemists to twist and turn the bass, changing direction at will. For the first time, the TB-303 can hold up to 64 patterns and 64 patches per bank. The eight variations of a pattern are still accessible on the UI faceplate. Plus, with 32 preset patterns and 48 unique sounds, the 303 arrives complete with sonic templates for you to explore. A hidden panel on the far-right corner of the 303 unlocks a variety of new tone-coloring features. Explore the expanded circuit modification via the new VCF trim, Vintage Condition, and Master Tune knobs. The onboard effects, including distortion and delay with tempo-sync, are sure to inspire fresh ideas. Roland Cloud’s TB-303 provides the means to emulate the past or lay down brave new pathways. It’s an instrument with a proud history of shaking up the status quo and defying expectations. Use the TB-303 to leave an imprint on tomorrow’s sounds and become part of a lasting musical legacy. Pairing with the TB-03 Roland Boutique synth or the TB-3 Touch Bassline provides hands-on control for the plug-in.

      "description": "THE RETURN OF AN UNDERGROUND CLASSIC The TR-606 Software Rhythm Composer is a detailed replica of the TR-606 Drumatix—an underground classic in the famous TR family of rhythm machines. The software version has the same sound and behavior of the original, plus powerful new features that virtually modify the circuitry for more sound choices and faster, more fluid programming. The Roland TR-606 Software Rhythm Composer is a detailed replica of the TR-606 Drumatix—an underground classic in the famous TR family of rhythm machines. The TR-606 was a programmable drum machine released in 1981. Originally designed as a companion to the TB-303 Bass Line, its size, price, and ease of use lowered the bar for quality music production, making it accessible to just about anyone. The punchy midrange kicks, popping toms, and sizzling hi-hats were a hit with DIY musicians and appear across an array of genres, from ‘80s new wave and punk to electronic styles. It’s the backbone of numerous classic tracks, and musicians continue to seek out the TR-606 for its alternative approach to the Roland TR sound. Original TR-606 units are increasingly hard to find and sell for significant sums on the used market. Using our proprietary ACB (Analog Circuit Behavior) technology, we’ve painstakingly recreated the original analog circuits that are the essence of the TR-606’s sound. Our plug-in sounds identical to the original TR-606—with all its nuance and detail—while adding new features that greatly expand its sound and creative capabilities for modern musicians and producers: The TR-606 plug-in integrates seamlessly with our TR-8S Rhythm Performer and Roland Boutique TR-06 hardware instruments. Transfer patterns from the TR-8S to the TR-606 plug-in, or create beats in your DAW and send them back to the hardware for live performance. And with its pre-mapped controls, you can use the TR-06 for hands-on operation of the plug-in. Join Roland Cloud today for the raucous sound of the TR-606, along with a host of other legendary Roland instruments. Curious to hear what came before the TR-606?

      "description": "The TR-808 Software Rhythm Composer is a detailed replica of the legendary TR-808—one of the most revered and sought-after electronic musical instruments of all time. Our plug-in recreation delivers all the boom, snap, and sizzle of the original hardware, plus modern enhancements for more sound design choices and faster beatmaking. + Highlights In 1980, Roland introduced the TR-808 Rhythm Composer as a quick and easy songwriting tool for musicians. At the time, the high cost of memory drove Roland engineers to use analog synthesis instead of samples for its sounds. Through a series of happy accidents—including unique transistor choices—they created a one-of-a-kind instrument that set the 808 in its own sonic universe. But like many legends to be, it was dismissed by many at the time. In a market looking for \"traditional\" or \"realistic\" sampled drum sounds, only about 12,000 units were made before the TR-808 was discontinued in 1983. Later in the 1980s, adventurous creators discovered the TR-808's untapped potential, and the music world changed forever. Emerging genres made heavy use of the 808 sound, with some utilizing it as the sonic signature of the style. The sizzling hi-hats and snappy snare, clicky rim shot, distinctive cowbell, and booming bass drum have been heard on an endless stream of worldwide hits and underground classics. And more continue to arrive every day. The TR-808's influence is so deep that it's been name-dropped in famous songs, had albums dedicated to it and bands named after it, and it's even the subject of a feature-length documentary film. Our proprietary circuit modeling technology brings the complete TR-808 sound experience to life in your DAW. The ACB process involves carefully analyzing original hardware units, circuit diagrams, and other historical data. We then use this information to recreate the unique architecture and authentic circuit behaviors of the vintage instrument. This gives the TR-808 plug-in its ultra-realistic sound that leaps from the speakers. While developing the TR-808 plug-in, we took the opportunity to improve on the original hardware while keeping the authentic experience intact. Workflow enhancements include an advanced multi-lane sequencer for faster programming, individual pan and gain controls for space and punch, and the ability to tune the bass drum and cowbell. Opening the sophisticated Edit view gives you independent step sequencer lanes per drum instrument, each with its own mute, solo, shuffle, and last-step settings. There are also per-step articulations, including weak hits, nine types of flams, and three types of sub steps for super-intricate patterns. While the TR-808 plug-in carefully models an instrument from the past, the implementation is thoroughly modern. The sequencer conveniently syncs to tempo, and you can drag and drop patterns created within the instrument as MIDI or audio directly to your DAW timeline. And it fits perfectly into your production environment with a freely resizable UI, support for VST3, AAX, and AU formats, and native compatibility with Apple silicon. The TR-808 plug-in comes with classic kits and patterns to get you started, and it's incredibly easy to program custom beats and tweak your own kits. But that's only the beginning. Roland Cloud offers a wealth of new patches and patterns from artists and expert sound designers to inspire your music. The TR-808 software instrument integrates seamlessly with our TR-8S Rhythm Performer and TR-08 Roland Boutique hardware. Import TR-8S patterns into the TR-808 plug-in and create beats in your DAW and send them back to the hardware. You can even use the hands-on panel controls on the TR-8S or TR-08 for direct operation of the plug-in. The TR-808 Software Rhythm Composer is available with Roland Cloud Pro (via Pro Selector) and Ultimate memberships or a Lifetime Key purchase. Roland Cloud is also home to software versions of other vintage Roland instruments plus ZENOLOGY, ZENOLOGY FX, Zenbeats, and other inspiring music tools to back your creative journeys.

      "description": "Synthesizers are in just about every style of modern music, so you need something versatile, authentic, and forward-thinking. ZENOLOGY embodies over 50 years of synthesizer research and development. Its roots go back to the dawn of synthesis. Its future will reshape your relationship with sound. + Standard Features For decades, Roland sounds have had a massive influence on music. Our legendary instruments have defined genres like techno, house, rap, trap, and hip hop, and deeply influenced pop, rock, and film music. This long legacy has culminated in the ZEN-Core Synthesis System. It's the most advanced sound engine we've ever made, powering our professional synthesizers like JUPITER-X and FANTOM, used on stages and in studios around the world. ZENOLOGY Pro is an expandable plug-in version of the ZEN-Core Synthesis System. ZEN-Core is based on discrete synth voices—each containing a flexible oscillator, filter, amplifier, dual LFOs, and effects. It mixes multiple synthesis types, combining vintage Roland oscillators and filters with PCM waves capable of sync and cross modulation. Layer up to four voices in a single tone for rich, complex sounds, both classic and modern. Roland effects processors are as revered as their legendary instrument counterparts. Spacious reverbs and delays, sweeping JUNO-106 and CE-1 choruses, and unique effects like the SDD-320 Dimension D and DJ-FX Looper are just some of ZENOLOGY Pro's over 90 effects that can shape and color your sound. ZENOLOGY Pro comes with thousands of patches, hundreds of drum kits, and all the tools you need to create nearly any sound from scratch. And you can go even further with the ever-expanding, always-evolving universe of creative options on Roland Cloud. Driven by the powerful ZEN-Core Synthesis System, a steady stream of new sounds and expansions focus on specific genres and instrument types or feature custom collections from leading artists. ZENOLOGY Pro's friendly and informative browser helps you find exactly what you're looking for. Filter and organize your sounds, rate favorites, and even create custom banks. No matter how you work, your sounds are never far away. From rare and sought-after classics to the designs of tomorrow, our growing collection of Model Expansions can instantly transform ZENOLOGY Pro into entirely different instruments, like the JUPITER-8, JUNO-106, SH-101, JX-8P, and JD-800. Using advanced modeling techniques to capture the essence of our legendary instruments, every Model Expansion has its own sonic personality, features, and preset tones. And they're optimized for high polyphony with interfaces inspired by the original hardware—but reimagined for your DAW. Explore ZENOLOGY Model Expansions Ready to dive into the world of custom sound design? ZENOLOGY Pro lets you harness the full power of the ZEN-Core Synthesis System on your computer. With the expansive interface and vast array of parameters, you can tweak existing sounds or craft all-new sounds that inspire your music. ZEN-Core is ultra-flexible and based on discrete synth voices called partials—each containing an oscillator, filter, amplifier, and dual LFOs. You can use up to four partials simultaneously, choosing from thousands of waveforms, ten modeled filter types, and more. Combining multiple synthesis types, lush effects, and deep modulation capabilities, you're able to develop big, complex sounds that demand attention. Low-frequency oscillators add movement to static sounds—and more LFOs mean more modulation possibilities. ZENOLOGY Pro has two LFOs per partial with 11 different LFO shapes. With four partials per tone, that's eight simultaneous LFOs in a patch! And the Step LFOs have 16 steps of beat-synced automation with 37 curve choices per step, perfect for creating evolving passages, modular-style animated textures, and sounds with deeply intricate motion. ZENOLOGY Pro has a huge selection of drum sounds and hundreds of ready-to-go kits, including famous Roland rhythm machines, natural acoustic kits, authentic electronic sounds, and exotic hybrid kits that use layers and combinations. Use them in your tracks as is, or mix and match to build dreamy custom kits. You get multiple edit views for precise control over each drum instrument, plus six dedicated drum compressors for maximum punch and impact. ZENOLOGY Pro works seamlessly with compatible Roland hardware like FANTOM, JUPITER-X, JUNO-X, and the RD-88. Use the same sounds in your DAW and hardware instruments, create custom banks, share with friends and collaborators, and tap into fresh inspiration with sounds from top artists and professional sound designers. You can even share Model Expansion sounds between ZENOLOGY Pro and compatible ZEN-Core hardware.

      "description": "The RD-2000 EX delivers the ultimate RD experience, fusing Roland’s top piano technologies with a rich array of modern creative tools. This powerful and inspiring instrument is the most complete stage piano solution available, offering dual sound engines, two pre-installed V-Piano Expansions, premium playability, and advanced controller features for professional performers. The RD-2000 EX represents the pinnacle of the Roland RD legacy, packing 50 years of piano development knowledge into a no-compromise instrument tailored for today’s performers. Two independent engines put our very best sounds at your fingertips, supported by a refined hammer-action keyboard for unmatched playability. Advanced controller features are also included, letting you manipulate sounds and integrate software and hardware synths via an intuitive, hands-on workflow. The RD-2000 EX features a sound engine powered by V-Piano technology, our acclaimed modeling approach that realizes the complex sound and interactive feel of an acoustic piano in astonishing detail. High-speed DSP eliminates the roadblocks of systems based solely on samples, providing natural response, unlimited expression, and full polyphony. There’s a wide selection of ready-to-play presets, and it’s possible to go much further if you want. With the onboard Piano Designer tools, you can adjust the tuning of individual notes, personalize tonal details, and craft unique instruments not possible in the physical world. In addition to the core V-Piano instrument, the RD-2000 EX extends your creative range with two V-Piano Expansion titles. Ideal for both solo work and ensemble performances, the German Concert expansion offers a versatile new voice inspired by famous concert-class grand pianos. The newly developed Essential Upright expansion brings a more intimate sonic flavor with the distinctive tones and unique spatial quality of a high-end upright piano. The RD-2000 EX offers a diverse selection of iconic electric pianos powered by Roland’s renowned SuperNATURAL engine. You also get an authentic recreation of the RD-1000—the breakthrough instrument that began the RD story in 1986—along with the MKS-20, a classic sound module heard on countless hits from the mid-’80s forward. Several vintage-style effects provide distinctive color, including spot-on recreations of the BOSS CE-1 Chorus Ensemble pedal and Roland SDD-320 Dimension D studio rack unit. The RD-2000 EX is not just a piano—it also includes over 1100 SuperNATURAL-driven sounds for any genre. Call up Virtual ToneWheel organs derived from the VK series, complete with a rotary effect and authentic drawbar control via the panel sliders. Cover electronic textures with modern and vintage synths. And explore even more styles with clavs, harpsichords, and other keyboard instruments, orchestral strings and brass, world sounds, and more. On the Roland Axial site, you’ll find genuine RD sound libraries ready to load into the RD-2000’s two expansion slots. Install the actual sounds from previous RD instruments like the RD-500, RD-600, and RD-700 series. Or expand your creative palette with the RD-EXP05 Virtual ToneWheel Organ and RD-EXP06 Analog/Digital Vintage Synth collections. Loaded with extensive controller features, the RD-2000 EX is ideal for commanding a large-scale performance setup. The panel is filled with knobs and sliders for quick hands-on control, and the knobs feature LED indicators for instant status updates and precise parameter tweaks. Eight assignable zones allow you to map sounds to different key ranges or create combination sounds with up to eight layers. With Scenes, you can save 100 snapshots containing all your keyboard settings and recall them with a touch. The RD-2000 EX features a USB audio/MIDI interface and control support for Apple MainStage, allowing you to work with virtual instruments and studio tracks alongside the internal RD sounds. The interface supports 24-bit audio at rates up to 192 kHz, so you can use your best sounds on every gig. With its versatile I/O, the RD-2000 EX is ready for any performance need. Main stereo outs are provided on XLR and ¼-inch jacks, giving you a balanced house feed and a secondary output for stage monitoring. An assignable sub output is also on hand to independently route internal sounds and USB audio to other destinations. Along with the USB audio/MIDI interface, there are traditional MIDI jacks to work with your favorite hardware. The RD-2000 EX offers the finest playability available in a stage instrument, delivering an inspiring experience that rivals our premier full-size grand pianos. With progressive hammer action, escapement, and advanced sensor detection, the PHA-50 keyboard is ready to unlock all the nuances of the deeply expressive acoustic and electric pianos. Innovative hybrid key construction combines wood and molded materials, offering both an authentic feel and rugged durability that will support years of live playing. The RD-2000 EX features multiple inputs for damper control and expression pedals. The DP-10 damper pedal is included, while the optional RPU-3 combines three pedals into one compact unit for a genuine grand piano experience. The optional KS-G8B stand features a sleek design, durable steel piping, and rigid bracing, providing solid support and three-way height adjustment for sitting or standing. The RD-2000 EX Upgrade available on Roland Cloud will equip an original RD-2000 model with EX specs, including the German Concert and Essential Upright V-Piano Expansion titles. The legendary songwriter and performer discusses Roland synthesizers, positive thinking, and music’s power to transform.Read more… Roland has always worked to create the ultimate electronic piano feel and sound.

      "description": "The CB-404 is the official carrying case for the Roland SP-404MKII and previous models in the iconic SP-404 portable sampler series. Streamlined and rugged, it features a semi-rigid EVA shell with a tough polyester exterior and a moveable internal partition that creates separate compartments for the sampler and items such as an AC adaptor. There’s also a detachable pouch for small items, plus a shoulder strap with a wide adjustment range. As a bonus, we’ve also included four orange knobs for customizing the look of the SP-404MKII model. Roland SP samplers are the bona fide kings of performance-based beatmaking, celebrated for their distinctive sound and ability to create rapid-fire beats anywhere. With the CB-404, you can be sure your SP instrument is well protected no matter where you travel. The CB-404’s semi-rigid EVA exterior provides durable protection with reduced weight. An internal partition is secured with hook-and-loop attachments, allowing you to adjust the compartment sizes for different SP-404 models and various accessories. A detachable pouch is fitted into the lid for stowing other small items and features a soft fabric material to protect the sampler’s faceplate. The CB-404 includes a tough shoulder strap with a wide adjustment range for different traveling styles. And when you want to carry the case by hand or stow it in a larger bag, simply remove the strap with the easy-to-detach clips. Many creators like to personalize the knobs and faceplate on the SP-404MKII to match their mood or style. The CB-404 comes with a set of four knobs in classic orange, allowing you to change up the look of your sampler in seconds. Note: The included knob set only works with the SP-404MKII model and is not available separately. Create with Confidence Light and Rugged Versatile Strap Design Custom Knobs",

      "description": "The KS-13 is a robust keyboard stand that looks great and is simple to use. The table-style platform works with a variety of instrument types, from lightweight synthesizers to heavy 88-key stage pianos. Angled legs provide rock-solid stability with plenty of clearance underneath, and you can easily adjust the width and height for your ideal playing comfort. The KS-13 allows you to make core stand adjustments without needing tools. Grab the quick-release lever to set the proper width for the keyboard you want to use. Then use the knobs on each leg to access three height settings to suit your situation. When you place your instrument on the KS-13, it’s supported with four large rubber grommets that eliminate movement while playing heavy rhythms, glissandos, and dynamic solos. And with the adjustable feet, you can dial in the legs for wobble-free operation on uneven floors. The KS-13 breaks down quickly for transportation and storage. Fold down the left/right leg pairs for carrying to the gig or stowing in a closet. Then swing them out and lock them in place when it’s time to play.

          "description": "Take online gaming sound to the next level with BRIDGE CAST, your all-in-one solution for premium livestream audio. This customizable desktop hub is packed with secret weapons to take out the competition, including dual sound mixes, vocal transformer effects, music playback, sound effects, and support for a broadcast-grade mic and headphones. In the heat of the battle, BRIDGE CAST ensures that your audio is always as epic as your gameplay. The companion BRIDGE CAST app takes your experience even further, allowing you to customize BRIDGE CAST audio features and enhance streams with royalty-free background music tracks and sound effects via BGM CAST and Roland Cloud. Learn how BRIDGE CAST's powerful audio tools will elevate your gaming streams with professional sound quality and easy real-time mixing control. BRIDGE CAST gives you what you need to deliver outstanding sound in every session, coupled with killer sonic tools to help you stand out from the crowd. Roland has been a leading innovator in electronic music and audio/video gear for over 50 years. With BRIDGE CAST on your desktop, you’ll be driving your sound with the brand trusted by generations of top creators worldwide. Connect BRIDGE CAST to your gaming computer via USB-C. Plug in a professional microphone to the XLR input. Hook up your headphones. Customize the audio and panel functions with the companion app. Set up personal and stream mixes with the hands-on controls. BRIDGE CAST lets you chat and interact using a broadcast-grade dynamic or condenser microphone, the foundation of any professional audio setup. The high-performance XLR mic preamp delivers clear, dynamic sound in the box, with no need for messy external add-ons. You get superior audio monitoring too, with a powerful headphone amplifier and high-sensitivity output for pro-quality phones. The versatile headphones connector also supports a headset mic for a quick, single-cable connection. With the dual audio mixer in BRIDGE CAST, you can independently balance the mic level, team chats, gameplay sounds, and background music for you and your viewers. Give yourself a winning advantage with a personal mix that prioritizes what you need to hear while gaming. Then create a separate stream mix that’s perfectly balanced for maximum online engagement. Along with a headphones output, BRIDGE CAST has a line output for external gaming speakers. Level knobs for each output let you easily control volumes and smoothly transition between phones and speakers during gameplay. There’s also a dedicated streaming level control to dial in the sound for your online audience. Morph your voice and become your character with fun processing derived from Roland’s famous VT voice transformer products. Adjust the pitch and formant to change your age or gender. Or go even further and take on the persona of a beast or alien. BRIDGE CAST also includes EQ, compression, and other pro vocal processing to level up your streams. A low-cut filter softens pesky “P” and “T” plosives, while the de-esser cleans up harsh “S” tones. There’s a noise suppressor to throttle background distractions, plus reverb to launch your voice into another dimension. And with the muscular hardware DSP handling the audio load, all your computer power is dedicated to gaming and streaming. Immerse yourself in 5.1 or 7.1 virtual surround sound for headphones and stereo speaker systems, powered by advanced Roland technology. Audio is converted from a PC to virtual surround sound via a USB connection, delivering a powerful and engaging sound experience. Slay your competition by highlighting important game sounds with Game EQ presets. Pinpoint audio frequencies and boost their levels to make it easier to hear critical elements, like enemy footsteps in first-person shooter games. You can even fine-tune while visually monitoring the analyzed waveform in real time. Once you find the ideal settings for different game titles, save them in onboard profiles and call them up with quick button presses while playing. Building your brand is an essential part of creating an online following. Choose your core BRIDGE CAST look with bold Black and Ice White finish options. And take it to another level by customizing the detachable faceplate using our downloadable skin template, which allows you to personalize the panel with your team or gamertag design. It’s also possible to customize the LED colors of the four control knobs for additional flair. The ergonomic BRIDGE CAST panel lets you easily control your mix while staying focused on the game. Everything you need is at your fingers, including grab-and-go level knobs and assignable buttons for muting sounds and accessing various functions. The rock-solid design won’t move around on your desktop, and the discrete rear-panel connections keep clutter in check. The powerful BRIDGE CAST app works in tandem with the hardware, giving you full access to an array of in-depth features. Dial in mic and audio parameters, configure Game EQ presets, and more. You can also re-assign hardware controls for your needs and save/recall custom BRIDGE CAST configurations for different games and streaming audiences. Using the BRIDGE CAST app, effortlessly tailor your sound with intuitive microphone settings for speed and precision. The version 5.00 update allows you to adjust EQ with quick-access controls and use the studio-grade compressor to achieve a clean, professional vocal sound with a single fader. There's also an expander that minimizes unwanted background noise without unnatural artifacts. With BGM CAST, adding background music and sonic color to streams has never been easier. Available through the BRIDGE CAST app and Roland Cloud, BGM CAST puts a growing selection of royalty-free background music and sound effects at your fingertips. Choose music by mood and genre or create playlists of your favorites for stress-free music management. You can also assign sound effects to the four hardware buttons for instant triggering. A free Roland Account provides 36 background music tracks and 16 sound effects to use at no charge. Signing up for Roland Cloud Core membership through the BRIDGE CAST app unlocks thousands of additional music tracks and hundreds of sound effects, with new selections added each month.

          "description": "The GP-3 is the most compact and affordable grand in the acclaimed GP series, bringing you premium piano performance in a unique low-profile design that makes a statement in any living space. Roland’s modern features and benefits are infused throughout, from the organic piano sound engine and responsive hammer-action keyboard to onboard recording, Bluetooth® audio/MIDI connectivity, and deep integration with the Roland Piano App. If you’ve always wanted a grand piano but thought you didn’t have the space or budget to make it happen, the GP-3 turns your dream into reality. The GP-3 is a marvel to behold, fusing traditional grand piano luxury with a streamlined design that’s only possible with a modern digital instrument. With a front-to-back depth of just 638 mm/25-1/8 inches, it easily fits where larger pianos can’t. The striking black gloss finish, classic curves, and fine details convey sophistication and grace, while the slim cabinet projects a commanding presence that belies its modest footprint. Embedded inside the GP-3’s elegant exterior is a complex piano ecosystem born of decades of Roland development. With our advanced Piano Reality approach, every element works together to deliver a complete piano experience, from the sound engine, keyboard, and pedals to the custom speaker system. And with easy volume control, mobile device connectivity, and other digital benefits, the GP-3 is a perfect fit for today’s lifestyles. The Piano Reality Standard sound engine authentically reproduces the living response and complex tonal colors of a genuine acoustic grand. That’s supported by the PHA-4 Standard keyboard with progressive hammer action, escapement, Ivory Feel material, and accelerated key sensing technology, putting the same touch beneath your fingers as a concert-grade acoustic instrument. Sustain, soft, and sostenuto pedals round out the grand experience, with true weighted feel and detection for traditional half-pedal techniques. The GP-3 features an integrated stereo speaker system specially tuned for top-quality sound and maximum projection from the low-profile cabinet design. Powerful amplification and advanced sonic processing deliver an immersive, room-filling piano experience for the player and listeners. You can even adjust the overall tone color by opening the lid—just like an acoustic grand. With onboard Bluetooth, it’s easy to elevate your piano enjoyment with mobile devices. Stream songs from your music library through the piano’s speaker system to play along or provide background when relaxing or entertaining. Or use Bluetooth MIDI with music production apps to wirelessly compose using the GP-3’s responsive weighted keyboard. USB ports are also available for connecting with computers and flash storage devices, providing more ways to explore your creativity and share music performances. The Roland Piano App seamlessly extends the GP-3 experience with remote operation from your smartphone or tablet. Select sounds, control the metronome, and use the recording feature to evaluate your playing and hear where you need to improve. Browse the piano’s onboard song library and call up digital scores to learn them at your own pace. And motivate yourself with lesson features that include an activity log with goals, flash card games, rhythm exercises, and a One Week Master program that guides you through learning different piano pieces. With its digital heart, the GP-3 brings you a world of advantages over a traditional acoustic piano. Volume control is within easy reach, and you can connect headphones to play anytime without disturbing others. Twin Piano mode enables you to play alongside a family member, friend, or teacher. And with no need for tuning and regular maintenance, the GP-3 will always sound as perfect as the day you bring it home. From living spaces large and small to performance venues and commercial establishments, there’s a GP model to meet every need. Mid-line GP model with an elegant baby grand cabinet and our advanced Piano Reality Modeling approach. Roland’s premier grand piano features a large, luxurious cabinet and our advanced Piano Reality Modeling approach for the ultimate musical experience. The GP-9 model expanded with features for performance venues, hotels, and restaurants, including moving keys, professional audio outputs, and a microphone input.

          "description": "The mid-level GP-6 offers premium GP features in a luxurious baby grand cabinet that brings a sense of sophistication to every space. Elegant curves and finely crafted details deliver the unmistakable presence of a fine acoustic grand, while the advanced technologies inside deliver the touch, tone, and sound projection to match. You also get a world of modern benefits that flow with today’s lifestyles, including low-maintenance operation, onboard learning tools, Bluetooth® connectivity, and much more. With its striking design and flowing curves, the GP-6 brings you majestic piano luxury in a reduced footprint compared to a larger grand piano. And while the size may be streamlined, you still get the no-compromise performance of a full-scale instrument. Like an acoustic grand, there’s a top lid that opens for broader sound projection and a retractable cover to protect the keys when not in use. Minimalist touch buttons disappear into the panel when the backlighting is turned off, allowing you to maintain the acoustic aesthetic and eliminate distractions while playing. Piano bench may vary by region. The GP-6 is built around advanced Roland’s Piano Reality approach, a sophisticated ecosystem of connected technologies comprising the sound engine, keyboard, pedals, audio components, and speakers. Each section is designed to work together flawlessly and transparently, allowing players to experience the purity of this wonderful instrument with unprecedented expression and realism. Piano Reality Modeling leverages our latest technologies to recreate every sound-making element of an acoustic piano, putting the living response and complex tonal colors of a concert-class grand under your fingers. And with unlimited polyphony, notes and resonances ring in full detail to translate every musical emotion. The PHA-50 Hybrid keyboard connects you with the deep musical expression available in the powerful sound engine. Progressive hammer action with escapement provides genuine grand piano touch, coupled with advanced acceleration sensing technology for accurate detection of the subtlest playing nuances. Hybrid wood/molded keys with Ivory Feel materials offer natural balance and rugged durability for years of trouble-free use. High-performance sustain, soft, and sostenuto pedals complete the experience with weighted feel, damper modeling, and support for traditional pedal techniques. The GP-6 projects a big acoustic voice from its baby grand cabinet, thanks to the Piano Reality Projection sound system. Five speakers, discrete amplification, superior audio circuitry, and advanced sonic processing come together to envelop the space around the instrument with immersive and inspiring tones. The GP-6 offers several world-class grand piano sounds that are ready to enjoy. But if you’re an experienced player, you can dive into the onboard Piano Designer tools to further refine the tone and response for your personal touch. Adjust the string tuning and temperament, fine-tune keyboard sensitivity and duplex scaling, shape cabinet resonances, and much more. With built-in Bluetooth, you can use your favorite mobile devices with the GP-6. Stream songs from your music library through the piano’s speaker system to play along or provide background when relaxing or entertaining. Or use Bluetooth MIDI with music production apps to wirelessly compose using the GP-6’s responsive weighted keyboard. USB ports are also available for connecting with computers and flash storage devices, providing more ways to explore your creativity and share music performances. The Roland Piano App seamlessly extends the GP-6 experience with remote operation from your smartphone or tablet. Select sounds, control the metronome, and use the recording feature to evaluate your playing and hear where you need to improve. Browse the piano’s onboard songs and a growing range of selections on Roland Cloud, and then call up digital scores to learn them at your own pace. And motivate yourself with lesson features that include an activity log with goals, flash card games, rhythm exercises, and a One Week Master program that guides you through learning different piano pieces. Greatly reduced weight makes the GP-6 far easier to move than any acoustic grand, and there’s no need for professional tuning or other regular maintenance. Volume control is within easy reach, and you can connect headphones to play anytime without disturbing others. The onboard metronome and simple rhythms help develop your sense of timing during daily practice sessions. And with Twin Piano mode, you can split the keyboard into two independent sections and play alongside a family member, friend, or teacher. From living spaces large and small to performance venues and commercial establishments, there’s a GP model to meet every need. Low-profile grand piano with a unique space-saving footprint and our Piano Reality Standard sound engine. Roland’s premier grand piano features a large, luxurious cabinet and our advanced Piano Reality Modeling approach for the ultimate musical experience.

          "description": "The GP-9 brings you Roland’s premier piano experience, offering refined musical expression in a sophisticated and luxurious instrument that makes a majestic statement in any space. Elegant curves and finely crafted details project the bold look of a world-class acoustic grand, while the advanced technologies inside deliver the touch, tone, and sound projection to match. You also get a world of modern benefits that flow with today’s lifestyles, including low-maintenance operation, onboard learning tools, Bluetooth® connectivity, and much more. The GP-9 embodies signature piano elegance with its flowing curves, solid lines, and striking high-gloss ebony and polished white finishes. Like an acoustic grand, the lid can be opened to different positions to adjust the sound character or closed to create a flat surface when not in use. Smart touch controls in the panel provide intuitive access to essential functions as needed. And when you’re ready to play, you can turn off their backlighting to eliminate distractions and maintain the acoustic aesthetic. The GP-9 is built around advanced Roland’s Piano Reality approach, a sophisticated ecosystem of connected technologies comprising the sound engine, keyboard, pedals, audio components, and speakers. Each section is designed to work together flawlessly and transparently, allowing players to experience the purity of this wonderful instrument with unprecedented expression and realism. Piano Reality Modeling leverages our latest technologies to recreate every sound-making element of an acoustic piano, putting the living response and complex tonal colors of a concert-class grand under your fingers. Modeled ambience is integrated into the sound engine, allowing you to play in realistic spaces such as an intimate studio, spacious concert hall, or large cathedral. And with unlimited polyphony, notes and resonances ring in full detail to translate every musical emotion. The Hybrid Grand keyboard provides unbounded expression with progressive hammer action, escapement, hybrid wood/molded key construction with Ivory Feel, and advanced acceleration sensing technology for accurate detection of the subtlest playing nuances. Fine details further elevate the feel, including long key pivot length and haptic vibration that emulates the subtle vibrations from an acoustic piano’s body. High-performance sustain, soft, and sostenuto pedals round out the authentic experience, offering weighted feel, damper modeling, and support for traditional pedal techniques. The GP-9 features the Piano Reality Projection sound system, where multi-channel amplification, premium audio circuitry, and advanced sonic processing come together for the ultimate full-surround piano experience. The cabinet construction, speaker placement, and lid angle have all been carefully tuned to deliver the same bold and immersive sound presentation as a concert grand in a performance hall. And notes naturally move across the immediate sound field as you play, mirroring the physical string positions on an acoustic grand’s soundboard. The GP-9 offers several world-class grand piano sounds that are ready to enjoy. But if you’re an experienced player, you can dive into the onboard Piano Designer tools to further refine the tone and response for your personal touch. Adjust the string tuning and temperament, fine-tune keyboard sensitivity and duplex scaling, shape cabinet resonances, and much more. With onboard Bluetooth, you can use your favorite mobile devices with the GP-9. Stream songs from your music library through the piano’s speaker system to play along or provide background when relaxing or entertaining. Or use Bluetooth MIDI with music production apps to wirelessly compose using the GP-9’s responsive weighted keyboard. USB ports are also available for connecting with computers and flash storage devices, providing more ways to explore your creativity and share music performances. The Roland Piano App seamlessly extends the GP-9 experience with remote operation from your smartphone or tablet. Select sounds, control the metronome, and use the recording feature to evaluate your playing and hear where you need to improve. Browse the piano’s onboard songs and a growing range of selections on Roland Cloud, and then call up digital scores to learn them at your own pace. And motivate yourself with lesson features that include an activity log with goals, flash card games, rhythm exercises, and a One Week Master program that guides you through learning different piano pieces. Greatly reduced weight (169.0 kg/372.6 lb.) makes the GP-9 far easier to move than any acoustic grand, and there’s no need for professional tuning or other regular maintenance. Volume control is within easy reach, and you can connect headphones to play anytime without disturbing others. The onboard metronome and simple rhythms help develop your sense of timing during daily practice sessions. And with Twin Piano mode, you can split the keyboard into two independent sections and play alongside a family member, friend, or teacher. The top-line GP-9M model features a moving key function for entertaining at home gatherings and commercial venues like restaurants and hotels. Call up songs from the piano’s extensive onboard library or MIDI files via USB flash media, and then watch and listen as the keys magically play themselves. View GP-9M From living spaces large and small to performance venues and commercial establishments, there’s a GP model to meet every need. Low-profile grand piano with a unique space-saving footprint and our Piano Reality Standard sound engine. Mid-line GP model with an elegant baby grand cabinet and our advanced Piano Reality Modeling approach.

          "description": "The GP-9M brings you Roland’s premier piano experience, offering refined musical expression in a sophisticated and luxurious instrument that makes a majestic statement in any space. This impressive piano includes the same flagship sound and features as its sister model, the GP-9, while adding moving keys, professional audio outputs, and a microphone input for singing along through the onboard speaker system. This makes the GP-9M ideal for performance venues, commercial establishments, and homeowners looking for the ultimate piano entertainment showcase. The GP-9M embodies signature piano elegance with its flowing curves, solid lines, and striking high-gloss ebony and polished white finishes. Like an acoustic grand, the lid can be opened to different positions to adjust the sound character or closed to create a flat surface when not in use. Smart touch controls in the panel provide intuitive access to essential functions as needed. And when you’re ready to play, you can turn off their backlighting to eliminate distractions and maintain the acoustic aesthetic. The GP-9M features a moving key function for entertaining at home gatherings and commercial venues like restaurants and hotels. Call up songs from the piano’s extensive onboard library or MIDI files via USB flash media, and then watch and listen as the keys magically play themselves. Roland Cloud also offers a growing library of songs that can be accessed via the Roland Piano App. Professional XLR outputs enable you to connect the piano directly to a house audio system in a performance venue or commercial establishment for broader sound coverage and independent control from the onboard speakers. All GP-9M sounds go to the outputs by default, but you can assign the dry piano sound, ambience only, or song playback to suit your needs. There’s a dedicated microphone input as well, allowing a performer to sing through the GP-9M’s sound system without the need for an external preamp or audio mixer. The GP-9M is built around advanced Roland’s Piano Reality approach, a sophisticated ecosystem of connected technologies comprising the sound engine, keyboard, pedals, audio components, and speakers. Each section is designed to work together flawlessly and transparently, allowing players to experience the purity of this wonderful instrument with unprecedented expression and realism. Piano Reality Modeling leverages our latest technologies to recreate every sound-making element of an acoustic piano, putting the living response and complex tonal colors of a concert-class grand under your fingers. Modeled ambience is integrated into the sound engine, allowing you to play in realistic spaces such as an intimate studio, spacious concert hall, or large cathedral. And with unlimited polyphony, notes and resonances ring in full detail to translate every musical emotion. The Hybrid Grand keyboard provides unbounded expression with progressive hammer action, escapement, hybrid wood/molded key construction with Ivory Feel, and advanced acceleration sensing technology for accurate detection of the subtlest playing nuances. Fine details further elevate the feel, including long key pivot length and haptic vibration that emulates the subtle vibrations from an acoustic piano’s body. High-performance sustain, soft, and sostenuto pedals round out the authentic experience, offering weighted feel, damper modeling, and support for traditional pedal techniques. The GP-9M features the Piano Reality Projection sound system, where multi-channel amplification, premium audio circuitry, and advanced sonic processing come together for the ultimate full-surround piano experience. The cabinet construction, speaker placement, and lid angle have all been carefully tuned to deliver the same bold and immersive sound presentation as a concert grand in a performance hall. And notes naturally move across the immediate sound field as you play, mirroring the physical string positions on an acoustic grand’s soundboard. The GP-9M offers several world-class grand piano sounds that are ready to enjoy. But if you’re an experienced player, you can dive into the onboard Piano Designer tools to further refine the tone and response for your personal touch. Adjust the string tuning and temperament, fine-tune keyboard sensitivity and duplex scaling, shape cabinet resonances, and much more. Customized settings can be recalled with a touch, a great feature for different pianists who play the GP-9M in a commercial environment or performance venue. With onboard Bluetooth, you can use your favorite mobile devices with the GP-9M. Stream songs from your music library through the piano’s speaker system to play along or provide background when relaxing or entertaining. Or use Bluetooth MIDI with music production apps to wirelessly compose using the GP-9M’s responsive weighted keyboard. USB ports are also available for connecting with computers and flash storage devices, providing more ways to explore your creativity and share music performances. The Roland Piano App seamlessly extends the GP-9M experience with remote operation from your smartphone or tablet. Select sounds, control the metronome, and use the recording feature to evaluate your playing and hear where you need to improve. Browse the piano’s onboard songs and selections on Roland Cloud, and then call up digital scores to learn them at your own pace. And motivate yourself with lesson features that include an activity log with goals, flash card games, rhythm exercises, and a One Week Master program that guides you through learning different piano pieces. Acoustic grand pianos are extremely heavy, difficult to move, and require professional tuning and other regular maintenance to keep them sounding their best. Thanks to their digital sound engines, GP pianos weigh drastically less than their acoustic counterparts. And they’re always perfectly in tune, producing outstanding sound every time you power on. Volume control is within easy reach, and you can connect headphones to play anytime without disturbing others. The onboard metronome and simple rhythms help develop your sense of timing during daily practice sessions. And with Twin Piano mode, you can split the keyboard into two independent sections and play alongside a family member, friend, or teacher. From living spaces large and small to performance venues and commercial establishments, there’s a GP model to meet every need.

          "description": "Released in 1981, the JUPITER-8 is one of the most revered and sought-after polysynths of all time. It appears on countless hit tracks spanning decades, and its lush analog sound is simply unmatched for warm pads, soaring strings, and infectious lead tones. With the JUPITER-8 Software Synthesizer, you get an authentic, down-to-the-circuit-level recreation of this vintage icon for your DAW or SYSTEM-8. + Highlights The JUPITER-8 is perhaps the most desirable analog polysynth ever, with original units going for extremely high prices on the used market. It represents the pinnacle of Roland engineering in the early 1980s, with a gorgeous design, robust build, and extreme sonic flexibility. The instrument’s incredibly warm-yet-clear sound is forever imprinted on the many essential music genres that emerged during its original release. And its influence has never diminished, appearing across a range of styles to this day. Aside from its iconic good looks and roadworthy build, the JUPITER-8 is famous for its unmistakable sound. Each of its eight voices had two stable VCOs with four waveforms to choose from, plus support for cross-modulation and screaming sync sounds. The creamy filter is renowned among synth aficionados with its selectable two- or four-pole low-pass VCF and non-resonant high-pass filter. Add in two envelopes, an onboard arpeggiator, and generous modulation capabilities, and you have the makings of a true legend. We’ve used our proprietary circuit modeling technology to bring the JUPITER-8 to life in your DAW or SYSTEM-8. The ACB process involves carefully analyzing original hardware units, circuit diagrams, and other historical data. We then use this information to recreate the authentic circuit behaviors of the vintage instrument, including all the beloved quirks and instabilities. This is what gives the JUPITER-8 Software Synthesizer its breathtakingly lifelike sound and unique character. While developing the JUPITER-8 plug-in, we felt it was important not to veer too far from the original’s classic workflow and sonic majesty. But we couldn’t resist adding a few modern touches like making it velocity sensitive, extending the oscillator range, adding an effects section, and enhancing the onboard arpeggiator for extra flexibility. The LFO, arpeggiator, and effects conveniently sync to tempo, and the plug-in fits perfectly into your production environment with a freely resizable, high-definition UI and support for VST3, AAX, and AU formats. Vintage synths like the JUPITER-8 had internal trim controls that allowed technicians to tweak various analog components when they drifted out of spec. But sometimes, “out of spec” created a sound that was unique, interesting, or extraordinary. Realized through our latest ACB advancements, the newly added Circuit Mod function lets you sweep through multiple trims using a single macro control. Along with the Condition parameter, which simulates the effects of aging, you can dial in everything from a factory-primed JUPITER-8 to a road-worn synth that hasn’t seen a tech bench in decades. The sophisticated browser lets you explore the JUPITER-8’s stunning collection of factory presets, your own custom sounds, and patches downloaded from Roland Cloud. Search across all installed patch banks, sort results, rate your favorites, jot down notes, and make quick adjustments with the integrated tweak panel. The JUPITER-8 Software Synthesizer offers full integration with the SYSTEM-8 keyboard. You can change the JUPITER-8’s plug-in panel to match the SYSTEM-8 for intuitive, one-to-one control. Or use the PLUG-OUT functionality to turn your SYSTEM-8 into a standalone JUPITER-8 that you can play in the studio or on stage. The JUPITER-8 Software Synthesizer is available with Roland Cloud Pro (via Pro Selector) and Ultimate memberships or a Lifetime Key purchase. Roland Cloud is also home to software versions of other vintage Roland instruments plus ZENOLOGY, ZENOLOGY FX, Zenbeats, and other inspiring music tools to back your creative journeys.

          "description": "Synthesizers are in just about every style of modern music, so you need something versatile, authentic, and forward-thinking. ZENOLOGY embodies over 50 years of synthesizer research and development. Its roots go back to the dawn of synthesis. Its future will reshape your relationship with sound. + Standard Features For decades, Roland sounds have had a massive influence on music. Our legendary instruments have defined genres like techno, house, rap, trap, and hip hop, and deeply influenced pop, rock, and film music. This long legacy has culminated in the ZEN-Core Synthesis System. It's the most advanced sound engine we've ever made, powering our professional synthesizers like JUPITER-X and FANTOM, used on stages and in studios around the world. ZENOLOGY Pro is an expandable plug-in version of the ZEN-Core Synthesis System. ZEN-Core is based on discrete synth voices—each containing a flexible oscillator, filter, amplifier, dual LFOs, and effects. It mixes multiple synthesis types, combining vintage Roland oscillators and filters with PCM waves capable of sync and cross modulation. Layer up to four voices in a single tone for rich, complex sounds, both classic and modern. Roland effects processors are as revered as their legendary instrument counterparts. Spacious reverbs and delays, sweeping JUNO-106 and CE-1 choruses, and unique effects like the SDD-320 Dimension D and DJ-FX Looper are just some of ZENOLOGY Pro's over 90 effects that can shape and color your sound. ZENOLOGY Pro comes with thousands of patches, hundreds of drum kits, and all the tools you need to create nearly any sound from scratch. And you can go even further with the ever-expanding, always-evolving universe of creative options on Roland Cloud. Driven by the powerful ZEN-Core Synthesis System, a steady stream of new sounds and expansions focus on specific genres and instrument types or feature custom collections from leading artists. ZENOLOGY Pro's friendly and informative browser helps you find exactly what you're looking for. Filter and organize your sounds, rate favorites, and even create custom banks. No matter how you work, your sounds are never far away. From rare and sought-after classics to the designs of tomorrow, our growing collection of Model Expansions can instantly transform ZENOLOGY Pro into entirely different instruments, like the JUPITER-8, JUNO-106, SH-101, JX-8P, and JD-800. Using advanced modeling techniques to capture the essence of our legendary instruments, every Model Expansion has its own sonic personality, features, and preset tones. And they're optimized for high polyphony with interfaces inspired by the original hardware—but reimagined for your DAW. Explore ZENOLOGY Model Expansions Ready to dive into the world of custom sound design? ZENOLOGY Pro lets you harness the full power of the ZEN-Core Synthesis System on your computer. With the expansive interface and vast array of parameters, you can tweak existing sounds or craft all-new sounds that inspire your music. ZEN-Core is ultra-flexible and based on discrete synth voices called partials—each containing an oscillator, filter, amplifier, and dual LFOs. You can use up to four partials simultaneously, choosing from thousands of waveforms, ten modeled filter types, and more. Combining multiple synthesis types, lush effects, and deep modulation capabilities, you're able to develop big, complex sounds that demand attention. Low-frequency oscillators add movement to static sounds—and more LFOs mean more modulation possibilities. ZENOLOGY Pro has two LFOs per partial with 11 different LFO shapes. With four partials per tone, that's eight simultaneous LFOs in a patch! And the Step LFOs have 16 steps of beat-synced automation with 37 curve choices per step, perfect for creating evolving passages, modular-style animated textures, and sounds with deeply intricate motion. ZENOLOGY Pro has a huge selection of drum sounds and hundreds of ready-to-go kits, including famous Roland rhythm machines, natural acoustic kits, authentic electronic sounds, and exotic hybrid kits that use layers and combinations. Use them in your tracks as is, or mix and match to build dreamy custom kits. You get multiple edit views for precise control over each drum instrument, plus six dedicated drum compressors for maximum punch and impact. ZENOLOGY Pro works seamlessly with compatible Roland hardware like FANTOM, JUPITER-X, JUNO-X, and the RD-88. Use the same sounds in your DAW and hardware instruments, create custom banks, share with friends and collaborators, and tap into fresh inspiration with sounds from top artists and professional sound designers. You can even share Model Expansion sounds between ZENOLOGY Pro and compatible ZEN-Core hardware.

          "description": "The RD-2000 EX delivers the ultimate RD experience, fusing Roland’s top piano technologies with a rich array of modern creative tools. This powerful and inspiring instrument is the most complete stage piano solution available, offering dual sound engines, two pre-installed V-Piano Expansions, premium playability, and advanced controller features for professional performers. The RD-2000 EX represents the pinnacle of the Roland RD legacy, packing 50 years of piano development knowledge into a no-compromise instrument tailored for today’s performers. Two independent engines put our very best sounds at your fingertips, supported by a refined hammer-action keyboard for unmatched playability. Advanced controller features are also included, letting you manipulate sounds and integrate software and hardware synths via an intuitive, hands-on workflow. The RD-2000 EX features a sound engine powered by V-Piano technology, our acclaimed modeling approach that realizes the complex sound and interactive feel of an acoustic piano in astonishing detail. High-speed DSP eliminates the roadblocks of systems based solely on samples, providing natural response, unlimited expression, and full polyphony. There’s a wide selection of ready-to-play presets, and it’s possible to go much further if you want. With the onboard Piano Designer tools, you can adjust the tuning of individual notes, personalize tonal details, and craft unique instruments not possible in the physical world. In addition to the core V-Piano instrument, the RD-2000 EX extends your creative range with two V-Piano Expansion titles. Ideal for both solo work and ensemble performances, the German Concert expansion offers a versatile new voice inspired by famous concert-class grand pianos. The newly developed Essential Upright expansion brings a more intimate sonic flavor with the distinctive tones and unique spatial quality of a high-end upright piano. The RD-2000 EX offers a diverse selection of iconic electric pianos powered by Roland’s renowned SuperNATURAL engine. You also get an authentic recreation of the RD-1000—the breakthrough instrument that began the RD story in 1986—along with the MKS-20, a classic sound module heard on countless hits from the mid-’80s forward. Several vintage-style effects provide distinctive color, including spot-on recreations of the BOSS CE-1 Chorus Ensemble pedal and Roland SDD-320 Dimension D studio rack unit. The RD-2000 EX is not just a piano—it also includes over 1100 SuperNATURAL-driven sounds for any genre. Call up Virtual ToneWheel organs derived from the VK series, complete with a rotary effect and authentic drawbar control via the panel sliders. Cover electronic textures with modern and vintage synths. And explore even more styles with clavs, harpsichords, and other keyboard instruments, orchestral strings and brass, world sounds, and more. On the Roland Axial site, you’ll find genuine RD sound libraries ready to load into the RD-2000’s two expansion slots. Install the actual sounds from previous RD instruments like the RD-500, RD-600, and RD-700 series. Or expand your creative palette with the RD-EXP05 Virtual ToneWheel Organ and RD-EXP06 Analog/Digital Vintage Synth collections. Loaded with extensive controller features, the RD-2000 EX is ideal for commanding a large-scale performance setup. The panel is filled with knobs and sliders for quick hands-on control, and the knobs feature LED indicators for instant status updates and precise parameter tweaks. Eight assignable zones allow you to map sounds to different key ranges or create combination sounds with up to eight layers. With Scenes, you can save 100 snapshots containing all your keyboard settings and recall them with a touch. The RD-2000 EX features a USB audio/MIDI interface and control support for Apple MainStage, allowing you to work with virtual instruments and studio tracks alongside the internal RD sounds. The interface supports 24-bit audio at rates up to 192 kHz, so you can use your best sounds on every gig. With its versatile I/O, the RD-2000 EX is ready for any performance need. Main stereo outs are provided on XLR and ¼-inch jacks, giving you a balanced house feed and a secondary output for stage monitoring. An assignable sub output is also on hand to independently route internal sounds and USB audio to other destinations. Along with the USB audio/MIDI interface, there are traditional MIDI jacks to work with your favorite hardware. The RD-2000 EX offers the finest playability available in a stage instrument, delivering an inspiring experience that rivals our premier full-size grand pianos. With progressive hammer action, escapement, and advanced sensor detection, the PHA-50 keyboard is ready to unlock all the nuances of the deeply expressive acoustic and electric pianos. Innovative hybrid key construction combines wood and molded materials, offering both an authentic feel and rugged durability that will support years of live playing. The RD-2000 EX features multiple inputs for damper control and expression pedals. The DP-10 damper pedal is included, while the optional RPU-3 combines three pedals into one compact unit for a genuine grand piano experience. The optional KS-G8B stand features a sleek design, durable steel piping, and rigid bracing, providing solid support and three-way height adjustment for sitting or standing. The RD-2000 EX Upgrade available on Roland Cloud will equip an original RD-2000 model with EX specs, including the German Concert and Essential Upright V-Piano Expansion titles. The legendary songwriter and performer discusses Roland synthesizers, positive thinking, and music’s power to transform.Read more… Roland has always worked to create the ultimate electronic piano feel and sound.

          "description": "The KS-13 is a robust keyboard stand that looks great and is simple to use. The table-style platform works with a variety of instrument types, from lightweight synthesizers to heavy 88-key stage pianos. Angled legs provide rock-solid stability with plenty of clearance underneath, and you can easily adjust the width and height for your ideal playing comfort. The KS-13 allows you to make core stand adjustments without needing tools. Grab the quick-release lever to set the proper width for the keyboard you want to use. Then use the knobs on each leg to access three height settings to suit your situation. When you place your instrument on the KS-13, it’s supported with four large rubber grommets that eliminate movement while playing heavy rhythms, glissandos, and dynamic solos. And with the adjustable feet, you can dial in the legs for wobble-free operation on uneven floors. The KS-13 breaks down quickly for transportation and storage. Fold down the left/right leg pairs for carrying to the gig or stowing in a closet. Then swing them out and lock them in place when it’s time to play. Fast Adjustment Maximum Stability Folding Design",

          "description": "Playing the piano is one of life’s most rewarding experiences, whether teaching yourself or watching your family discover a passion for music. Roland’s HP700 series supports your ambitions with gorgeous piano sound, sophisticated styling, and helpful features that’ll keep you coming back for more. And with the flexibility and expression to suit any genre or playing standard, you’ll have an instrument that grows with you. Whatever your reasons for owning a piano, the HP700 series can help fulfill them—bringing style, culture, and music into the heart of your home. An HP700 piano can be the centerpiece of a room—or so discreet you hardly know it’s there. For silent practice day or night, connect headphones and enjoy immersive sound that won’t disturb your family or neighbors. For interactive study, wirelessly connect the piano with your smartphone via Bluetooth® and play along with your favorite tunes or sharpen your skills with online tutorials. For performance, adjust the volume-controllable internal speakers to fill the room with music. And when you’re not playing, you can use the HP700 piano as your home entertainment system, streaming music with clear, detailed highs and rich, powerful lows. The Headphones 3D Ambience feature makes your playing sound like it’s coming from the heart of the piano, providing a rich, immersive experience for your private music sessions. With built-in Bluetooth wireless audio support, you can stream music from your smartphone through the piano’s powerful internal speakers—perfect for social gatherings and practice sessions. Practice sessions are fun and productive when you play along with the vast selection of onboard tunes. Choose from classical, pop, and jazz pieces, complete with full orchestral accompaniment. Studying piano doesn’t have to mean endless work. Just five minutes of focused daily practice can improve your playing—especially with the Roland Piano App. It runs on your smartphone or tablet and communicates with the piano via Bluetooth, so it’s always ready for action. Find your favorite tunes, play along, and record your performance or practice session. Then listen back to assess the areas that need attention, even when you’re away from the piano. It’s the fast-track route to better playing and way more enjoyable than just practicing over and over. The One Week Master program guides you through learning a piece of music in just seven days. Choose from the large variety of folk, jazz, and classical pieces in your HP700 series piano, and then start the challenge. From the app, you can browse the piano’s song library, listen to selections, and call up sheet music to learn them yourself. Slow the tempo to go at your own pace and mute the left- or right-hand part as needed to focus on each hand individually. The app’s Timeline feature logs each practice session with your HP700 piano, making it easy to keep track of how often you’re playing. Staying inspired is the key to enjoying any musical instrument, and the HP700 series gives you the touch, tone, and features to explore a variety of musical genres and playing styles. The responsive keyboard and powerful sound engine deliver authentic piano performance, supporting you during first steps right through to developing professional techniques. Unlike most digital pianos, the HP700 series features SuperNATURAL Piano Modeling, an advanced technology that reproduces the complex physical interactions that occur when an acoustic piano creates sound. You’ll hear—and feel—the difference in every note you play. The Hybrid Keyboard combines the beautiful look and familiar feel of a wooden keyboard with the durability of modern molded materials, eliminating regular maintenance costs. The Progressive Damper Action pedal accurately replicates the damper pedal behavior of an acoustic piano, enabling traditional techniques like half-pedaling, As a parent, nothing beats watching your child discover a creative new hobby. When you choose the right piano, you’ll give them a passion for life and help them to appreciate music while teaching them how to overcome challenges and achieve goals. Find out why the HP700 series is the perfect first step on their musical journey. Make a bold statement—or keep things subtle. Taking inspiration from the elegant and curvaceous cabinets of traditional pianos—with a modern twist—the HP series brings sophistication to any home or décor. Plus, with compact dimensions, a smaller footprint, and lighter weight than a traditional acoustic, you can move your HP700 piano around until you find the perfect spot. Timeless and elegant cabinet designs that satisfy modern tastes. With the control panel concealed beneath the keyboard lid, each HP piano has a streamlined look that won’t distract you during a performance. Backed by Roland’s advanced sound technology, the onboard speakers deliver dynamic, full-range sound during practice, performance, or parties. Children thrive when learning a musical instrument, and choosing the right one helps spark their passion and keeps them playing. With expressive tones that bring the music to life and a responsive keyboard at their fingertips, an HP700 series piano ensures they stay inspired and keen to improve—especially when they hook up the piano to their smartphone and play along to their favorite music. Introducing the Roland HP700 series: pianos to inspire your child’s creativity. Between school, clubs, and homework, kids lead hectic lives—which makes it tough to find time for piano practice. While playing an acoustic piano can disturb others, the HP700 series lets your children either reduce the volume or plug in headphones and concentrate on learning piano while family life goes on around them. It’s the flexible solution that lets them play any time they like. Open the lid and the piano is ready to play—no need to press the power button. The controls are directly in the line of sight, so kids can glance down, find what they need, and focus on their practice. The HP704’s music rest is also angle-adjustable to match your child’s sitting height, letting them get comfortable and dive into the music. Headphones are especially useful for young musicians, letting them practice at any time of the day or night. Thanks to the Headphones 3D ambience feature, they’ll experience the immersive acoustic effect of playing in a real concert hall without disturbing anyone else. And with the volume limit function, you can set the maximum volume of the phones or onboard speakers to ensure their hearing is always protected. The Roland Piano App can track your child’s daily playing, giving you instant updates on their progress. It’s a great way to bond with your child over their new hobby while taking part in their musical journey and encouraging them to keep going. Timeline lets you check the tunes your child has played and view how long they’ve practiced. And with the recording function, you can listen back to their performance using your smartphone or tablet. It’s great for young musicians to have targets, and the One Week Master program helps your child learn a piece of music in just seven days. With the HP700’s song collection spanning many genres, they’re sure to find something that inspires them, while you follow their progress using the app. For your child to improve, it’s important that they practice between piano lessons. And with the HP700 series, that doesn’t have to mean boring exercises. With a variety of built-in tutorial features, the HP700 series makes learning so much fun that you’ll never have to persuade your child to practice. The Do Re Mi lesson feature substitutes the usual piano notes with spoken phrases (do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do), allowing your child to learn scales by singing along with the onboard tunes. To make it even easier and more fun, use the Roland Piano App to display the digital music score on your smartphone or tablet. In addition, learning to play in time to a beat is the first step towards your child performing music with others, and the HP700’s built-in metronome provides an essential tool to help develop their sense of rhythm. When your child sits alongside you—or their piano teacher—you can divide the keyboard into left and right areas, so that two people can play in the same note ranges. It’s a great tutorial aid that makes it easy for your child to copy what you demonstrate. It also provides a convenient way for two children to practice at the same time. When your child finds the musical genre that sparks their passion, practice sessions become a pleasure. Each HP700 piano contains over 380 songs ranging from classical and pop to jazz, with arrangements and skill levels to match their playing standard. Let your child discover tunes from popular modern genres or sharpen their classical skills with 287 piano études from legends like Charles-Louis Hanon, complete with full orchestral accompaniment. Along with its powerful education tools, the Roland Piano App provides access to interactive scores for the HP700’s song library. It’s frustrating to invest in an entry-level piano only to realize that its feel and tone are holding your child back. But with the HP700 series, they’ll be supported along every step of their musical journey. Authentic tones and a welcoming feel provide first-timers with great sound and the inspiration to keep going. And as their skills develop, these pianos really keep up.

          "description": "GALAXIAS brings 50 years of legendary Roland synths and drum machines together into one powerful Super Instrument. Access thousands of iconic sounds and freely combine authentic Roland instruments from vintage to modern. Explore supermassive GALAXIAS Scenes filled with intricate layers and deep macro controls. And discover exciting new worlds with infinite creative possibilities. + Highlights Roland has been a pioneer in music technology for over half a century, delivering a continuous stream of influential instruments and effects that have fueled countless hits, defined genres, and driven cultural trends. With GALAXIAS, you can now explore and experience them all in one creative environment. From historic icons such as the JUPITER-8, TR-808, and D-50 to modern instruments like ZENOLOGY GX and SYSTEM-8, GALAXIAS harnesses Roland’s evolving sonic legacy within a single intuitive workflow. Choose from your favorite Roland synths and drum machines, search specific sound types, or mine the ever-expanding collection of over 25,000 sounds to spark new ideas and build compelling tracks. GALAXIAS puts unlimited albums’ worth of inspiration at your command—from vintage sounds to futuristic hybrid tones—with more added each month. GALAXIAS lets you layer up to four instruments to create massive sonic superclusters called Scenes. Build an intricate setup of your favorite Roland instruments, such as a full stack of JUPITER and JUNO synths, or multiple eras of TR drum machines locked in perfect sync. Dial in an arpeggiator pattern (or four), quickly define key ranges and macro controls, and then play the whole thing as a single instrument in the studio or on stage. Seamlessly integrated into GALAXIAS, ZENOLOGY GX delivers over 11,000 genre-defining Roland sounds in one powerful instrument. Layer up to four instances with definable key ranges, sophisticated macro controls, per-layer effects, and creative tools like ARPS and CHORDS. Explore the vast collection of presets or craft your own using 23 authentic oscillator and filter models, over 7,000 PCM waveforms, 11 LFO shapes—including a versatile Step LFO for rhythmic movement—and 90+ effects. From studio to stage, ZENOLOGY GX puts limitless sonic potential at your fingertips. Every layer in GALAXIAS has its own key range, transpose, and MIDI input settings. The convenient learn and drag functionality makes it fast and easy to build intricate, layered sounds that are deeply engaging and demand attention. Experience a new level of expression and playability with the ultra-powerful macro controls in GALAXIAS. Easily assign any instrument, effect, or mix parameter to the 16 color-coded knobs and link them to a MIDI controller for real-time operation. Control multiple parameters at once and manipulate them by hand or via tempo-synced LFOs. And with the Smart Link function, you can define parameter ranges and inversions with one simple action. In addition to the formidable effects within each individual instrument, GALAXIAS gives you two insert effects per layer and two global send effects. Choose from the growing collection of authentic Roland and BOSS effects and take your sounds to new frontiers. You can also route layers to external outputs or channels in your DAW for further processing. Glistening arp patterns, thundering bass lines, and emotive chord progressions are only a few clicks away. Along with the onboard pattern sequencers in many of the individual instruments, GALAXIAS provides a powerful arpeggiator and dynamic chord sequencer on each layer. This feature will grow with more sequencer options and other creative tools in future updates. The inspiring GALAXIAS interface has been carefully forged for rapid creativity and instant satisfaction. You don’t need a manual to get going, and it’s easy to go deep to quickly translate your ideas into great-sounding tracks. In fact, GALAXIAS may well be your starting point in every creative session and, paired with your favorite DAW, can take your music to unexplored territory. While GALAXIAS can run as a standalone instrument, it also works as a multichannel plug-in for browsing, playing, and recording directly in your DAW. Arpeggiators, pattern sequencers, and LFOs sync with the master tempo, and you can even drag and drop MIDI and audio directly to tracks with some instruments. And with the future GALAXIAS roadmap, that’s only the beginning. Delve into a single instrument layer, go deep into the full set of parameters, and get the experience of using the original hardware. With the full-screen Immersive Mode, you can toggle your focus between the entire Scene and an individual instrument or effect using a single click or key command. Open GALAXIAS and you’ll find it bursting with instruments, sounds, effects, and creative tools to inspire your music. Powered by Roland Cloud, GALAXIAS takes full advantage of all the instruments and effects that Ultimate membership offers, delivering a sound palette of truly epic proportions. GALAXIAS is a rapidly evolving platform instrument that will continue to improve with new sounds and capabilities added regularly. With full access to the growing library of Roland instruments and effects—and the ability to search across thousands of sounds in an instant—the GALAXIAS creative journey will only get better with time.

With the CB-404, you can be sure your SP instrument is well protected no matter where you travel. The CB-404’s semi-rigid EVA exterior provides durable protection with reduced weight.

          "description": "THE SOUND THAT GAVE BIRTH TO A MOVEMENT With an unmistakable sonic signature brimming with warmth, energy, and character, the Roland TB-303 Bass Line defined the acid house movement of the late 1980s. Widely misunderstood when launched in 1981, the true revolution began several years later when electronic music producers rediscovered the quirky box, unleashing the hypnotic, liquid sound that captivated a generation. The TB-303 Software Bass Line delivers this historic instrument in a DAW plug-in, with circuit-level sonic accuracy and useful modern enhancements. 303 DAY: DJ Pierre and the Roland TB-303 Some instruments are so groundbreaking they create entire musical genres. The TB-303 is one of these influential instruments, but it wasn’t always seen that way. When Roland released the TB-303 in 1981, it was marketed as a computerized bass machine to simulate a traditional bass guitar, but didn’t quite catch on. Later on, inventive electronic musicians discovered the 303, often on the secondhand market, and found new uses for its recognizably fluid low end. Using the 303 in new ways, DJ Pierre and Phuture pioneered what came to be known as acid. This new sound ignited other electronic music genres and, like the Roland TR-808’s influence on hip-hop, the TB-303 played an essential role in late ‘80s-early ‘90s rave culture. While we may never really understand why the 303 sound makes people want to dance, there’s no denying its power, influence, and unwavering ability to get a party started. The TB-303 Software Synthesizer takes the classic instrument to the next level. Utilizing Analog Circuit Behavior modeling the virtual TB-303 captures the hypnotic tone of the original hardware and forms the perfect complement to the TR-909 and other classic Roland instruments. The iconic interface and signature crunch and squelch of the original are perfectly reproduced, while adding new features which surely would have turned heads back in the day: The 303’s new editing window is one of the most striking features. For the first time, you can create and edit patterns with a visual interface. With the ability to see the DNA of a preset pattern, you can edit a variation, or start from scratch then step-edit a new pattern, using up to six octaves with user-defined scales, accents, slides, pitch manipulation, and more. The new randomize/generate functions create an endless supply of classic 303 patterns. With five new play modes (Forward/Reverse/FWD&REV/Invert/Random) the TB-303 Software Synthesizer widens the ability to experiment. These new functions allow sonic alchemists to twist and turn the bass, changing direction at will. For the first time, the TB-303 can hold up to 64 patterns and 64 patches per bank. The eight variations of a pattern are still accessible on the UI faceplate. Plus, with 32 preset patterns and 48 unique sounds, the 303 arrives complete with sonic templates for you to explore. A hidden panel on the far-right corner of the 303 unlocks a variety of new tone-coloring features. Explore the expanded circuit modification via the new VCF trim, Vintage Condition, and Master Tune knobs. The onboard effects, including distortion and delay with tempo-sync, are sure to inspire fresh ideas. Roland Cloud’s TB-303 provides the means to emulate the past or lay down brave new pathways. It’s an instrument with a proud history of shaking up the status quo and defying expectations. Use the TB-303 to leave an imprint on tomorrow’s sounds and become part of a lasting musical legacy. Pairing with the TB-03 Roland Boutique synth or the TB-3 Touch Bassline provides hands-on control for the plug-in.

          "description": "THE RETURN OF AN UNDERGROUND CLASSIC The TR-606 Software Rhythm Composer is a detailed replica of the TR-606 Drumatix—an underground classic in the famous TR family of rhythm machines. The software version has the same sound and behavior of the original, plus powerful new features that virtually modify the circuitry for more sound choices and faster, more fluid programming. The Roland TR-606 Software Rhythm Composer is a detailed replica of the TR-606 Drumatix—an underground classic in the famous TR family of rhythm machines. The TR-606 was a programmable drum machine released in 1981. Originally designed as a companion to the TB-303 Bass Line, its size, price, and ease of use lowered the bar for quality music production, making it accessible to just about anyone. The punchy midrange kicks, popping toms, and sizzling hi-hats were a hit with DIY musicians and appear across an array of genres, from ‘80s new wave and punk to electronic styles. It’s the backbone of numerous classic tracks, and musicians continue to seek out the TR-606 for its alternative approach to the Roland TR sound. Original TR-606 units are increasingly hard to find and sell for significant sums on the used market. Using our proprietary ACB (Analog Circuit Behavior) technology, we’ve painstakingly recreated the original analog circuits that are the essence of the TR-606’s sound. Our plug-in sounds identical to the original TR-606—with all its nuance and detail—while adding new features that greatly expand its sound and creative capabilities for modern musicians and producers: The TR-606 plug-in integrates seamlessly with our TR-8S Rhythm Performer and Roland Boutique TR-06 hardware instruments. Transfer patterns from the TR-8S to the TR-606 plug-in, or create beats in your DAW and send them back to the hardware for live performance. And with its pre-mapped controls, you can use the TR-06 for hands-on operation of the plug-in. Join Roland Cloud today for the raucous sound of the TR-606, along with a host of other legendary Roland instruments. Curious to hear what came before the TR-606?

          "description": "The TR-808 Software Rhythm Composer is a detailed replica of the legendary TR-808—one of the most revered and sought-after electronic musical instruments of all time. Our plug-in recreation delivers all the boom, snap, and sizzle of the original hardware, plus modern enhancements for more sound design choices and faster beatmaking. + Highlights In 1980, Roland introduced the TR-808 Rhythm Composer as a quick and easy songwriting tool for musicians. At the time, the high cost of memory drove Roland engineers to use analog synthesis instead of samples for its sounds. Through a series of happy accidents—including unique transistor choices—they created a one-of-a-kind instrument that set the 808 in its own sonic universe. But like many legends to be, it was dismissed by many at the time. In a market looking for \"traditional\" or \"realistic\" sampled drum sounds, only about 12,000 units were made before the TR-808 was discontinued in 1983. Later in the 1980s, adventurous creators discovered the TR-808's untapped potential, and the music world changed forever. Emerging genres made heavy use of the 808 sound, with some utilizing it as the sonic signature of the style. The sizzling hi-hats and snappy snare, clicky rim shot, distinctive cowbell, and booming bass drum have been heard on an endless stream of worldwide hits and underground classics. And more continue to arrive every day. The TR-808's influence is so deep that it's been name-dropped in famous songs, had albums dedicated to it and bands named after it, and it's even the subject of a feature-length documentary film. Our proprietary circuit modeling technology brings the complete TR-808 sound experience to life in your DAW. The ACB process involves carefully analyzing original hardware units, circuit diagrams, and other historical data. We then use this information to recreate the unique architecture and authentic circuit behaviors of the vintage instrument. This gives the TR-808 plug-in its ultra-realistic sound that leaps from the speakers. While developing the TR-808 plug-in, we took the opportunity to improve on the original hardware while keeping the authentic experience intact. Workflow enhancements include an advanced multi-lane sequencer for faster programming, individual pan and gain controls for space and punch, and the ability to tune the bass drum and cowbell. Opening the sophisticated Edit view gives you independent step sequencer lanes per drum instrument, each with its own mute, solo, shuffle, and last-step settings. There are also per-step articulations, including weak hits, nine types of flams, and three types of sub steps for super-intricate patterns. While the TR-808 plug-in carefully models an instrument from the past, the implementation is thoroughly modern. The sequencer conveniently syncs to tempo, and you can drag and drop patterns created within the instrument as MIDI or audio directly to your DAW timeline. And it fits perfectly into your production environment with a freely resizable UI, support for VST3, AAX, and AU formats, and native compatibility with Apple silicon. The TR-808 plug-in comes with classic kits and patterns to get you started, and it's incredibly easy to program custom beats and tweak your own kits. But that's only the beginning. Roland Cloud offers a wealth of new patches and patterns from artists and expert sound designers to inspire your music. The TR-808 software instrument integrates seamlessly with our TR-8S Rhythm Performer and TR-08 Roland Boutique hardware. Import TR-8S patterns into the TR-808 plug-in and create beats in your DAW and send them back to the hardware. You can even use the hands-on panel controls on the TR-8S or TR-08 for direct operation of the plug-in. The TR-808 Software Rhythm Composer is available with Roland Cloud Pro (via Pro Selector) and Ultimate memberships or a Lifetime Key purchase. Roland Cloud is also home to software versions of other vintage Roland instruments plus ZENOLOGY, ZENOLOGY FX, Zenbeats, and other inspiring music tools to back your creative journeys.
