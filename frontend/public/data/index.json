        "Enjoy Traditional Piano Feel with 88 Standard-Size Keys\n\nGO:PIANO88 has 88 full-size keys for authentic playing feel and expressive touch inspired by the keyboards on acoustic grand pianos. Having the full range of notes lets you play more demanding music, and helps develop the correct techniques for both left and right hands. It also ensures a smooth transition should you play a weighted hammer-action keyboard. And even if you invest in a premium piano, your GO:PIANO88 is the ideal portable instrument for slinging in a gigbag and playing at rehearsals, sessions and shows.",
        "Connect Wirelessly To Your Smartphone, Access Online Content and Learn Faster\n\nGO:PIANO88 pairs with your smartphone to make learning piano fun. Use Bluetooth to connect wirelessly to your smartphone or tablet, then access songs from your music library or try some free online lessons. You can play along as the music streams through the high-quality onboard speakers or your headphones. Or if you’d prefer some more intensive piano training, try some of the many excellent apps or tutorial videos, before you start working with a personal piano teacher.",
        "Enjoy Authentic Piano Performance with a Compact, Space-Saving Footprint\n\nNot every home has space for a full-size acoustic piano. But the compact design of GO:PIANO88 lets you play in any setting, with all the benefits of 88 full-size keys. Just sit down, switch on and enjoy GO:PIANO88’s full dynamic range, free from setup hassles or tangled wiring. Plus, to ensure you can practice without disturbing others, GO:PIANO88 lets you plug in headphones to play in peace.",
        "Make Music on the Move with Battery Power and a Wireless Smartphone Connection\n\nAn acoustic piano ties you to one location, while portable electronic keyboards limit the type of music you can play as they have fewer keys. With GO:PIANO88 and a smartphone, you’re ready to make music whenever inspiration strikes. With its compact 7.5kg design and battery-powered operation, GO:PIANO88 lets you perform through its speakers or practice with headphones. Plus, with wireless connectivity to your smartphone, you can work on your skills any time, any place – especially as the 88-note full-size keyboard means your technique won’t be compromised.",
        "Get Inspired with Roland’s Responsive Piano Sounds\n\nAs you appreciate GO:PIANO88‘s 88-note full-size keyboard, you’ll also be inspired by the choice of onboard sounds derived from Roland’s acclaimed premium pianos. Touch the keys and you’ll hear notes full of character, changing seamlessly in response to your touch, just like on a fine acoustic piano. And alongside the expressive keyboard, GO:PIANO88 lets the dynamics of your playing shine through, encouraging you to improve faster as your skills grow. GO:PIANO88 also includes electric pianos, organs, and other sounds so you can explore different musical styles."
