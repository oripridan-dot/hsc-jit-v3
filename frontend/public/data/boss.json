      "description": "A Bold New Voice for Sound Innovators\n\nEvery guitarist is on a highly personal tone journey, continually honing their skills and searching for the perfect gear combination to unleash their full potential. The EURUS concept presents a bold new creative path for adventurous sonic explorers, expanding the traditional guitar experience with powerful and expressive BOSS technologies. Born from this breakthrough approach, the EURUS GS-1 infuses a premium instrument with advanced guitar synthesis techniques refined over more than four decades. Deep, inspiring, and infinitely playable, the EURUS GS-1 will take your musical vision where it’s never gone before.\n\nDownload “GS-1 Editor” for iOS\nDownload “GS-1 Editor” for Android\n\nThe EURUS GS-1 fully leverages BOSS’s vast expertise in guitar technology to bring endless creative possibilities to your music. This inspiring instrument has all the sound, feel, and detail you’d expect from a pro-quality guitar, coupled with a polyphonic BOSS synth engine that offers a stunning range of analog-flavored sounds to launch your musical expression into a new dimension. And with onboard Bluetooth®, you can customize synth sounds and control multiple performance parameters with the convenience of wireless connectivity.\n\nThe synth engine in the EURUS GS-1 delivers exceptional sonic quality and natural touch response realized through 40-plus years of BOSS guitar synthesizer development. The six onboard memories come filled with ready-to-play sounds, and you have access to many, many more with the GS-1 Editor. There’s also a synth control knob that enables a wide range of dynamic expression as you play. Every synth sound offers smooth playability that fully responds to all your guitar techniques, with no latency or triggering issues to disturb your musical flow.\n\nThe GS-1 Editor app for iOS and Android mobile devices unlocks deep programming power for the guitar’s synth engine. Many different synth types and variations are available for crafting sounds, along with tone, resonance, and other adjustable parameters. You can also assign a range of target parameters to the guitar’s synth control knob and save favorite sound combinations on your device for quick loading before performances.\n\nThe optional EV-1-WL Wireless MIDI Expression Pedal brings cable-free external control to the EURUS GS-1 via Bluetooth®. Using the GS-1 Editor, you can assign parameters such as pitch bend, hold, filter depth, and more to the EV-1-WL’s pedal, toe switch, and up to two external footswitches. Each sound can contain its own set of assignments, allowing you to perform octave bends on a synth lead, slow filter sweeps on a pad sound, and nearly anything else you can dream up.\n\nCrafted in Japan with pro-quality details and components, the EURUS GS-1 is truly a pleasure to play. The modern offset body design is stylish and well-balanced, and the slim-profile neck features a compound radius fretboard for playing comfort and 24 frets for extended range. High-performance Gotoh hardware delivers smooth tremolo action and solid tuning stability with a two-point fulcrum bridge and staggered-height locking machine heads. Custom designed for the EURUS GS-1, the two humbucking pickups provide wide-range tone plus split-coil voicing at two stops of the five-way switch.\n\nThe guitar and synth electronics are fully independent in the EURUS GS-1, allowing you to switch between the two voices seamlessly. Use it as a regular guitar, then instantly transition to the selected synth sound with the flip of a switch. And with the two ¼-inch outputs, you can send the guitar and synth to separate destinations for dedicated processing.\n\nGuitar synthesizers have come a long way.

      "description": "Rapid Retuning, Flawless Sound\n\nThe XS-1 Poly Shifter delivers instant retuning in a convenient, compact footprint. Driven by advanced BOSS algorithms years in the making, this magical pedal transforms the overall pitch while maintaining your instrument’s true character. You get speedy tracking, crystal-clear response, and zero compromise in tone—whether shifting down, simulating a capo, or using extreme octave jumps for effect. The versatile XS-1 unlocks a new level of performance freedom, making tuning changes fast, fluid, and seamless.\n\nIn developing the XS series, BOSS engineers pioneered new methods to advance real-time pitch shifting and eliminate the tonal artifacts common in conventional designs. Powered by finely tuned algorithms and a specially selected DSP platform, the XS-1 provides balanced polyphonic performance that feels natural and musical across all playing styles, pickup positions, and pedal setups. Your instrument’s attack and tonal character are fully preserved, and even complex chords and sustained lead tones—typically a challenge for pitch shifters—are reproduced with stunning clarity.\n\nRetuning during a performance means long pauses, instrument swaps, or pedal solutions that can color the sound in undesirable ways. With the XS-1, you can shift tunings on demand and retain great sound, feel, and response—without ever breaking the momentum of a show. Authentically play songs in drop tunings, change keys to suit a vocalist’s range, create unique extended-range sounds, and more.\n\nOffering a range of +/- seven semitones and three octaves up or down, the XS-1 adapts to virtually any musical need. Thanks to the signature BOSS compact interface, dialing in sounds is fast and intuitive. With semitone tunings, you’ll usually want to set the Balance knob for effect only to avoid pitch conflicts. For octave shifts, use it to blend in the direct sound for 12-string effects, parallel guitar/bass sounds, and unexplored colors. There’s also a Detune mode to create evocative doubling effects with high-definition tone.\n\nThe XS-1 provides a variety of control options to meet your creative intent. With the flip of a panel control, you can assign the pedal switch for standard on/off toggle use or momentary operation. Connect up to two external footswitches for fast access to alternate tuning modes with your preferred Balance settings. Or add an expression pedal to transform the XS-1 into a dynamic pitch-bending tool for dramatic, ear-turning shifts.\n\nHow BOSS mastered the three As of pitch shifting—Attack, Authenticity, Accuracy—with the XS-1 and XS-100, setting new industry standards.Read more…\n\nDiscover what pitch shifter pedals do, how they work, and why they’re essential tools for guitarists seeking new tones and creative freedom.Read more…\n\nExplore decades of industry-leading BOSS pitch pedal innovation, from the classic OC-2 Octave to the advanced XS-1 and XS-100 Poly Shifters.Read more…\n\nWatch inspiring demo videos and discover new techniques on how to transform your music-making with the BOSS OC-5, PS-6, XS-1, and XS-100.Read more…\n\nA clear guide to the complete BOSS pitch range—learn how the XS-1, XS-100, OC-5, and PS-6 can reshape your sound and inspire new ideas.Read more…\n\nThe London-based guitarist walks us through his history, the power of the XS-100 Poly Shifter, and how he'd explain his style to his granny.Read more…\n\nStraight to right-angle 1/4-inch connectors, 10 ft./3 m length.

      "description": "Colorful Tones, Portable Design\n\nPlayers everywhere love the GX-100 for its streamlined design, free-flowing interface, and high-quality tones. Armed with the core GX-100 engine, the compact GX-10 brings you the same inspiring experience in an even more portable footprint. You get loads of AIRD amps and effects for covering every style, plus speedy sound building with the intuitive color touch display and panel knobs. Adding in multi-mode footswitches, an integrated expression pedal, and USB audio connectivity, the GX-10 seamlessly transitions from nightly stage performing to desktop recording, song creation, and daily practice sessions.\n\n*Compatibility with all third-party devices and software is not guaranteed.\n\nDownload “BTS for GX-10” for iOS\nDownload “BTS for GX-10” for Android\nDownload “BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-10” for Windows/macOS\n\nThe GX-10 brings you a universe of ultra-responsive BOSS tone processing in a travel-ready size. Take on every playing situation with 23 guitar amps and nine bass amps, including high-gain X-Ultra, X-Optima, and X-Titan types crafted with our latest technologies. And let your imagination run wild with 170 effects, including overdrives and distortions, mod effects, delays, and reverbs, plus dedicated bass effects and BOSS classics like Slow Gear, Octave, Slicer, and more.\n\nThe GX-10 enables fast sound creation with its inviting color touch display and four dynamic parameter knobs. Assign up to two amps and 15 effects in each memory. Create serial or parallel effect routings and change the order by dragging blocks with a finger on the screen. And patch in your go-to external pedals with the send/return loop. BOSS Tone Studio takes things even further, allowing you to edit sounds and load IRs from your computer or wirelessly tweak tones via our optional Bluetooth adaptor and the mobile version of the app.\n\nPacking clever control options into a minimal layout, the GX-10 gives you powerful tools for real-time sound adjustment while performing. Versatile control modes provide maximum flexibility with just three footswitches. The expression pedal toggles between volume and wah and activates the tuner when you pull the pedal back. But you can customize it to control nearly anything you want with the GX-10’s assign matrix.\n\nUp/Down Mode—Simplify your rig by scrolling through memories one at a time. Set up basic memories for clean, crunch rhythm, and lead sounds. Or load up the 66 banks and 198 user memories with custom sounds for your set list and tap through them sequentially on stage.\n\nManual Mode—This reconfigures the footswitches to control three user-assignable targets. Use them like a pedalboard to turn effects on/off or kick in a solo boost. Or go deeper by changing up to 20 assignable parameters with just one press.\n\nBank/Number Mode—This mode allows you to select memories within banks. It also unlocks the Current Number function, providing access to one or more parameters by pressing the switch for the currently loaded memory. Using this function, you can extend your tonal options for each memory with a solo boost, delay effect, or anything else you’d like to assign.\n\nIn addition to editing, BOSS Tone Studio allows you to organize GX-10 sounds into Livesets for different gigs and playing situations. You can also access BOSS Tone Exchange within the app to download professionally created sounds and share GX-10 Livesets with the global BOSS community. GX-100 Livesets are fully compatible with the GX-10 as well. In addition, there’s a built-in USB-C audio interface for capturing high-quality guitar tones in music production apps on computers and mobile devices.\n\nBOSS multi-effects combine a full arsenal of tones, effects, and amp models into a single, streamlined unit, offering a flexible alternative to traditional pedalboard setups.Read more…\n\nAn exciting world of effects awaits keyboardists from rotary, chorus, flanging, and phasing to reverb, delay, distortion, loopers, and more.Read more…\n\nGX is the latest addition to the comprehensive BOSS range of multi-effects processors, offering extreme flexibility with intuitive control.Read more…\n\nHigh-quality footswitch cap for select BOSS products.\n\nCarrying case for the BOSS GX-10, GT-1, and GT-1B.\n\nDurable metal footswitch available in latching and unlatching types.\n*Some products are compatible with either FS-5U or FS-5L only. Please check the specs to confirm the suitable model.\n\nTwo switches in one, BOSS’s FS-6 combines latch- and momentary-type switching into one unit.\n\nCompact, multifunctional dual footswitch for remote control of effect pedals or amp channel switching.\n\nSmooth and precise expression control in a pedalboard-friendly size.\n\nTank-tough diecast volume pedals with high/low impedance option.\n\nDurable expression pedal for use with keyboards or other Expression-compatible instruments to control a range of functions and effects parameters.\n\nCompact adaptor that brings Bluetooth wireless capabilities to compatible BOSS and Roland products.\n\nPowerful MIDI expression pedal for controlling devices through Bluetooth MIDI, USB, and TRS MIDI outputs.\n\nCustomizable Bluetooth foot controller for software applications and MIDI hardware.\n\nStraight to right-angle 1/4-inch connectors, 10 ft./3 m length. Available in black (BIC-10A-BK), orange (BIC-10A-OR), yellow (BIC-10A-YL), green (BIC-10A-GN), red (BIC-10A-RD), and blue (BIC-10A-BU).\n\nIf you have questions about operating your BOSS product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support department by phone or email.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",
