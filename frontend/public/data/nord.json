Organ Section The Organ Section is based on the Nord Organ 3 engine and features stunning recreations of classic tonewheel, transistor, and pipe organs as well as the latest generation of our acclaimed Rotary Speaker emulation with multiple microphone perspectives. B3 The B3 model features three different tone wheel modes ranging from the clean sound of a factory new unit to a road worn vintage character with increased tone wheel cross talk and leakage. The B3 Percussion effect includes a Poly mode, which enables polyphonic use of the Percussion even when holding chords or playing legato. Vox The iconic sound of the Vox organ has been refined even further for the Nord Electro 7, with revamped waveform shapes and filters as well as updates to both the key click and vibrato character. Farfisa The new generation Farfisa model conveys the character of the original tone generators and filters with great precision, including the complex filter interactions when combining registers. Soft B3 and Pipe The Soft B3 model is based on the B3 tone wheel organ, but without the key click and other artifacts, for a softer and more mellow sound. The Pipe model faithfully recreates a set of principal pipe organ ranks. Vibrato and Chorus Scanner The new vibrato and chorus captures the unique qualities of the original instruments, offering either the gentle character of a '50s B3 chorus scanner or the deep modulation of a '70s instrument. Rotary Speaker emulation With a brand new approach to recreating not only the classic rotary sound, but also the characteristics of both the amp and speakers, the Nord Electro 7 features the exceptional Rotary Speaker emulation from the Nord Organ 3. Microphone perspectives The Nord Electro 7 offers three microphone positioning options corresponding to popular ways of reproducing the classic rotary speaker sound, both on stage and in the studio. These variations in microphone placement affect both the perceived movement as well as the tonal character of the rotary speaker, ranging from punchy and present to smooth and open. The illustration below shows the selectable configurations for the Nord Electro 7 “Mic Pos” feature. New Organ engine from the Nord Organ 3 New Rotary Speaker emulation from the Nord Organ 3 3 mic positions for the Rotary Speaker B3, B3 Bass, Vox, Farfisa, Soft B3 and Pipe models B3 with 3 different tone wheel modes Piano Section The Nord Electro 7 contains a large selection of Grands, Uprights and Electric Pianos from the exclusive Nord Piano Library along with new features such as Dynamic Compression, Unison and Timbre.

With its powerful panel interface and pre-programmed modulation matrix, creating unique and exciting sounds is very inspirational and quick. Overview Specifications Sounds Downloads Images & videos Accessories Main features Oscillators Unique Oscillator concept 8 Oscillator Configurations Pitch, Detune, Shape, Sync, AM, Noise, Sub Mix, FM Traditional Analog and Digital Waveforms Unison Filter 12, 24 dB low-pass filters High-pass and Band-pass filters Transistor and diode ladder filter simulations of Mini and TB-303 Modulation LFO with 5 waveforms Mod Envelope LFO as additional ModEnv Performance 4-part multi-timbral Master Clock Sync of Arpeggiator, LFO and Delay Velocity and Mod Wheel Morph USB MIDI Effects Ensemble, Chorus, Phaser, Flanger, Ring Modulator, Drive Special features Mutator Like Button Extra Fat Unison mode Analog Modeling At the heart of the Lead A1 is our new analog modeling engine. Taking our virtual analog synthesis to the next level, this modeling recreates a total analog signal path with uncanny realism, and is capable of immense sonic variety. With 26-voice polyphony and four simultaneous synthesizer parts, the Lead A1 is a true synthesizer powerhouse that goes far beyond the current trend for limited capability analog reissues. Intuitive interface Fundamental to the design of the Lead A1 is a brand new simple yet sophisticated front panel interface. The design is in fact the result of requests from professional players – even the most experienced programmers - who need to create the perfect sound as quickly as possible for today's live or studio time demands. The Lead A1 allows easy patch creation and experimentation thanks to a new and unique oscillator section, pre-programmed modulation matrix, and simplified ADR envelopes. Dive in and create incredible patches far quicker than would normally be possible with a synthesizer of such power. Oscillator Section The Lead A1's new Oscillator section generates 47 different waveforms from classic analog to digital harmonic and inharmonic waves, whilst unique Oscillator Configuration Shortcuts make programming more immediate than ever. Start with a single Oscillator waveform select an Oscillator Configuration Shortcut - Pitch, Detune, Shape, Sync, Sub Mix, FM, AM or Noise - and use the Adjust knob to adjust the settings of the configuration. The end result is high speed programming without the need for the usual complexity of routing and patching, and with the opportunity for ready experimentation. A fast track to stunning sound design for both advanced and less experienced programmers. Oscillator Configurations Pitch - adjusts the pitch of the original oscillator. DeTune - adds a second oscillator, with control over its pitch. Sub Mix - adds a second oscillator, with a choice of waveform shapes and pitches. Shape - The shaping of the Analog, Extended Analog and Fixed Pulse waveforms uses a traditional waveshaping method, the other waveforms are changed with a spectral shaping process. Sync - emulates Hard sync by adding an additional oscillator that is the sync reference. FM - Oscillator 1 will be modulated by a sine wave from oscillator 2 at high frequencies. There are several different pitch offsets for oscillator 2 (-12 to +48 semitones). AM - uses a second oscillator to create Amplitude Modulation. Noise - adds a Noise element to the original oscillator, Osc Control sets the mix. Filter Section The Lead A1's filter section features classic 12 and 24 dB Low Pass, a High Pass and a Band Pass filter, together with stunning emulations of the diode and ladder filters from the legendary Mini and the TB-303 synthesizers as used in the Lead 4. The Lead A1's modeling of these filters capture the true character and response of the originals, allowing supremely flexible and precise sound design. The filters are super-smooth with a warm analog character. Effect Section The Lead A1's effects section features two stunning brand new analog models of an Ensemble and Chorus, modeled on specific vintage synths and adding classic warmth and analog feel. Alongside these, choose from great-sounding Ring Modulation, Phaser, Flanger, or Drive per slot, and in addition a separate Delay and Reverb for each slot. Mod wheel and velocity morph A classic Nord feature, the Morph function via Mod Wheel, Velocity or pedal, allows you to control multiple parameters of the Lead A1 simultaneously. Morph is exceptionally easy to set-up and use - just hold the Morph button and adjust any desired knob. Arpeggiator The Lead A1 features four separate Arpeggiators with Up/Down and Random modes and a 4-octave range. Any or all can be sync'd to the Lead A1's master clock. Master Clock The Master Clock function of the Lead A1 allows the LFO, Arpeggiator and Delay to be synchronized, either internally or slaved to external MIDI clock. A Tap Tempo button allows you to easily tap to the tempo of a drummer or to playback tracks. Splits and layers Having four identical, equally powerful synthesizers at once opens breathtaking layering possibilities. The Split-mode gives you two 2 slots on each side of the split. A flexible Hold functionality lets you latch and hold slots independently in the background while playing something else on top. Multi-Focus Mode New in the Lead A1 is the Multi-Focus Mode that allows editing and control of all four slots simultaneously. Save this mode as part of a Performance and you have live realtime control over all four slots of the Lead A1. Four outputs The Lead A1 features four independent audio outputs with the ability to route each slot to a different output. Plus control of Pan via the front panel knob is a welcome new addition in the Lead A1. Special features Like button Unique to the Nord Lead A1 is the new 'Like' function, a simple and brilliant practical feature to use during patch creation. When programming a patch it's often not clear if it's yet perfect. Now with the Lead A1 you can simply 'Like' what you've done into a temporary location and continue editing. You can Like up to 50 variations, with the ability to scroll between them to compare your favourites or go back to a specific Liked version to edit in a different way. When you're ready, save your favourite patch or patches to the Lead A1's memory. Mutator Function A popular feature of the Lead 4, the Mutator function allows variations of a patch to be created by adjusting one, some, or all elements of a patch by set percentages. There's also a wild Randomize mode to create an entirely new patch with all parameters randomized. Extra Fat Unison mode A newly designed \"Fat-As-Fat-Can-Be\" Unison Mode let's the Lead A1 challenge any vintage analog instrument.

Carefully balanced for playability and portability, the new Kawai keybed delivers excellent responsiveness for acoustic and electric pianos. Organ Section The Organ Section is based on the Nord Organ 3 engine and features stunning recreations of classic tonewheel, transistor, and pipe organs as well as the latest generation of our acclaimed Rotary Speaker emulation with multiple microphone perspectives. B3 The B3 model features three different tone wheel modes ranging from the clean sound of a factory new unit to a road worn vintage character with increased tone wheel cross talk and leakage. The B3 Percussion effect includes a Poly mode, which enables polyphonic use of the Percussion even when holding chords or playing legato. Vox The iconic sound of the Vox organ has been refined even further for the Nord Electro 7, with revamped waveform shapes and filters as well as updates to both the key click and vibrato character. Farfisa The new generation Farfisa model conveys the character of the original tone generators and filters with great precision, including the complex filter interactions when combining registers. Soft B3 and Pipe The Soft B3 model is based on the B3 tone wheel organ, but without the key click and other artifacts, for a softer and more mellow sound. The Pipe model faithfully recreates a set of principal pipe organ ranks. Vibrato and Chorus Scanner The new vibrato and chorus captures the unique qualities of the original instruments, offering either the gentle character of a '50s B3 chorus scanner or the deep modulation of a '70s instrument. Rotary Speaker emulation With a brand new approach to recreating not only the classic rotary sound, but also the characteristics of both the amp and speakers, the Nord Electro 7 features the exceptional Rotary Speaker emulation from the Nord Organ 3. Microphone perspectives The Nord Electro 7 offers three microphone positioning options corresponding to popular ways of reproducing the classic rotary speaker sound, both on stage and in the studio. These variations in microphone placement affect both the perceived movement as well as the tonal character of the rotary speaker, ranging from punchy and present to smooth and open. The illustration below shows the selectable configurations for the Nord Electro 7 “Mic Pos” feature. New Organ engine from the Nord Organ 3 New Rotary Speaker emulation from the Nord Organ 3 3 mic positions for the Rotary Speaker B3, B3 Bass, Vox, Farfisa, Soft B3 and Pipe models B3 with 3 different tone wheel modes Piano Section The Nord Electro 7 contains a large selection of Grands, Uprights and Electric Pianos from the exclusive Nord Piano Library along with new features such as Dynamic Compression, Unison and Timbre.

With its powerful panel interface and pre-programmed modulation matrix, creating unique and exciting sounds is very inspirational and quick. Overview Specifications Sounds Downloads Images & videos Accessories Main features Oscillators Unique Oscillator concept 8 Oscillator Configurations Pitch, Detune, Shape, Sync, AM, Noise, Sub Mix, FM Traditional Analog and Digital Waveforms Unison Filter 12, 24 dB low-pass filters High-pass and Band-pass filters Transistor and diode ladder filter simulations of Mini and TB-303 Modulation LFO with 5 waveforms Mod Envelope LFO as additional ModEnv Performance 4-part multi-timbral Master Clock Sync of Arpeggiator, LFO and Delay Velocity and Mod Wheel Morph USB MIDI Effects Ensemble, Chorus, Phaser, Flanger, Ring Modulator, Drive Special features Mutator Like Button Extra Fat Unison mode Analog Modeling At the heart of the Lead A1 is our new analog modeling engine. Taking our virtual analog synthesis to the next level, this modeling recreates a total analog signal path with uncanny realism, and is capable of immense sonic variety. With 26-voice polyphony and four simultaneous synthesizer parts, the Lead A1 is a true synthesizer powerhouse that goes far beyond the current trend for limited capability analog reissues. Intuitive interface Fundamental to the design of the Lead A1 is a brand new simple yet sophisticated front panel interface. The design is in fact the result of requests from professional players – even the most experienced programmers - who need to create the perfect sound as quickly as possible for today's live or studio time demands. The Lead A1 allows easy patch creation and experimentation thanks to a new and unique oscillator section, pre-programmed modulation matrix, and simplified ADR envelopes. Dive in and create incredible patches far quicker than would normally be possible with a synthesizer of such power. Oscillator Section The Lead A1's new Oscillator section generates 47 different waveforms from classic analog to digital harmonic and inharmonic waves, whilst unique Oscillator Configuration Shortcuts make programming more immediate than ever. Start with a single Oscillator waveform select an Oscillator Configuration Shortcut - Pitch, Detune, Shape, Sync, Sub Mix, FM, AM or Noise - and use the Adjust knob to adjust the settings of the configuration. The end result is high speed programming without the need for the usual complexity of routing and patching, and with the opportunity for ready experimentation. A fast track to stunning sound design for both advanced and less experienced programmers. Oscillator Configurations Pitch - adjusts the pitch of the original oscillator. DeTune - adds a second oscillator, with control over its pitch. Sub Mix - adds a second oscillator, with a choice of waveform shapes and pitches. Shape - The shaping of the Analog, Extended Analog and Fixed Pulse waveforms uses a traditional waveshaping method, the other waveforms are changed with a spectral shaping process. Sync - emulates Hard sync by adding an additional oscillator that is the sync reference. FM - Oscillator 1 will be modulated by a sine wave from oscillator 2 at high frequencies. There are several different pitch offsets for oscillator 2 (-12 to +48 semitones). AM - uses a second oscillator to create Amplitude Modulation. Noise - adds a Noise element to the original oscillator, Osc Control sets the mix. Filter Section The Lead A1's filter section features classic 12 and 24 dB Low Pass, a High Pass and a Band Pass filter, together with stunning emulations of the diode and ladder filters from the legendary Mini and the TB-303 synthesizers as used in the Lead 4. The Lead A1's modeling of these filters capture the true character and response of the originals, allowing supremely flexible and precise sound design. The filters are super-smooth with a warm analog character. Effect Section The Lead A1's effects section features two stunning brand new analog models of an Ensemble and Chorus, modeled on specific vintage synths and adding classic warmth and analog feel. Alongside these, choose from great-sounding Ring Modulation, Phaser, Flanger, or Drive per slot, and in addition a separate Delay and Reverb for each slot. Mod wheel and velocity morph A classic Nord feature, the Morph function via Mod Wheel, Velocity or pedal, allows you to control multiple parameters of the Lead A1 simultaneously. Morph is exceptionally easy to set-up and use - just hold the Morph button and adjust any desired knob. Arpeggiator The Lead A1 features four separate Arpeggiators with Up/Down and Random modes and a 4-octave range. Any or all can be sync'd to the Lead A1's master clock. Master Clock The Master Clock function of the Lead A1 allows the LFO, Arpeggiator and Delay to be synchronized, either internally or slaved to external MIDI clock. A Tap Tempo button allows you to easily tap to the tempo of a drummer or to playback tracks. Splits and layers Having four identical, equally powerful synthesizers at once opens breathtaking layering possibilities. The Split-mode gives you two 2 slots on each side of the split. A flexible Hold functionality lets you latch and hold slots independently in the background while playing something else on top. Multi-Focus Mode New in the Lead A1 is the Multi-Focus Mode that allows editing and control of all four slots simultaneously. Save this mode as part of a Performance and you have live realtime control over all four slots of the Lead A1. Four outputs The Lead A1 features four independent audio outputs with the ability to route each slot to a different output. Plus control of Pan via the front panel knob is a welcome new addition in the Lead A1. Special features Like button Unique to the Nord Lead A1 is the new 'Like' function, a simple and brilliant practical feature to use during patch creation. When programming a patch it's often not clear if it's yet perfect. Now with the Lead A1 you can simply 'Like' what you've done into a temporary location and continue editing. You can Like up to 50 variations, with the ability to scroll between them to compare your favourites or go back to a specific Liked version to edit in a different way. When you're ready, save your favourite patch or patches to the Lead A1's memory. Mutator Function A popular feature of the Lead 4, the Mutator function allows variations of a patch to be created by adjusting one, some, or all elements of a patch by set percentages. There's also a wild Randomize mode to create an entirely new patch with all parameters randomized. Extra Fat Unison mode A newly designed \"Fat-As-Fat-Can-Be\" Unison Mode let's the Lead A1 challenge any vintage analog instrument.
