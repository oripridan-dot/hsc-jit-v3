Combining our latest piano features with the Organ and Rotary Speaker from the acclaimed Nord Organ 3, the Nord Electro 7 offers exceptional versatility in a lightweight, stage-ready instrument.\n\n73-note Semi-Weighted Waterfall keybed\n\nThe new panel design, paired with a high-resolution color display enhances ease of use. Sound selection, settings and performance controls are easily accessible for a quick and intuitive workflow.\n\n► Pitch Stick and Modulation Wheel on 73 and HP models\n\nThe Electro 7 73 and HP models feature Pitch Stick and Modulation Wheel for additional real time control.\n\n► Physical Drawbars with LEDs on all models\nAll Electro 7 models feature Physical Drawbars with LED indicators for both visual and tactile feedback and hands-on experience.\n\n► New HP model with Kawai Hammer Action\nThe Electro 7 HP model introduces a new lightweight triple sensor keybed developed in collaboration with Kawai. Carefully balanced for playability and portability, the new Kawai keybed delivers excellent responsiveness for acoustic and electric pianos.\n\nThe Organ Section is based on the Nord Organ 3 engine and features stunning recreations of classic tonewheel, transistor, and pipe organs as well as the latest generation of our acclaimed Rotary Speaker emulation with multiple microphone perspectives.\n\nThe B3 model features three different tone wheel modes ranging from the clean sound of a factory new unit to a road worn vintage character with increased tone wheel cross talk and leakage. The B3 Percussion effect includes a Poly mode, which enables polyphonic use of the Percussion even when holding chords or playing legato.\n\nThe iconic sound of the Vox organ has been refined even further for the Nord Electro 7, with revamped waveform shapes and filters as well as updates to both the key click and vibrato character.\n\nThe new generation Farfisa model conveys the character of the original tone generators and filters with great precision, including the complex filter interactions when combining registers.\n\nThe Soft B3 model is based on the B3 tone wheel organ, but without the key click and other artifacts, for a softer and more mellow sound. The Pipe model faithfully recreates a set of principal pipe organ ranks.\n\nThe new vibrato and chorus captures the unique qualities of the original instruments, offering either the gentle character of a '50s B3 chorus scanner or the deep modulation of a '70s instrument.\n\nWith a brand new approach to recreating not only the classic rotary sound, but also the characteristics of both the amp and speakers, the Nord Electro 7 features the exceptional Rotary Speaker emulation from the Nord Organ 3.\n\nThe Nord Electro 7 offers three microphone positioning options corresponding to popular ways of reproducing the classic rotary speaker sound, both on stage and in the studio. These variations in microphone placement affect both the perceived movement as well as the tonal character of the rotary speaker, ranging from punchy and present to smooth and open.\n\nThe illustration below shows the selectable configurations for the Nord Electro 7 “Mic Pos” feature.\n\nThe Nord Electro 7 contains a large selection of Grands, Uprights and Electric Pianos from the exclusive Nord Piano Library along with new features such as Dynamic Compression, Unison and Timbre.

The latest generation of our Organ series featuring massive improvements to sound, design and performance. With a greatly enhanced organ engine, added modulation effects and a new exceptional-sounding rotary speaker emulation, the Nord Organ 3 offers an unsurpassed level of detail and realism.\n\nTransistor and Pipe Organs\n\nRotary and Amp modeling\n\nThe Nord Organ 3 features meticulously crafted emulations of iconic tonewheel and transistor organs with hands-on controls. Each model is the result of detailed analysis of carefully selected vintage instruments, capturing every nuance of the legendary organ sounds.\n\nThe B3 model features three different tone wheel modes ranging from the clean sound of a factory new unit to a road worn vintage character with increased tone wheel cross talk and leakage.\n\nKey Click is an important characteristic of the B3 sound and is recreated in great detail on the Nord Organ 3. The three options are selectable from the panel and allows for quick fine tuning of the Key Click level.\n\nThe B3 Percussion effect includes a Poly mode, which enables polyphonic use of the Percussion even when holding chords or playing legato. The DB9 Cancel setting allows for deactivating the 9th drawbar when Percussion is turned on, as on the original instrument.\n\nThe iconic sound of the Vox organ has been refined even further for the Nord Organ 3, with revamped waveform shapes and filters as well as updates to both the key click and vibrato character.\n\nThe new generation Farfisa model conveys the character of the original tone generators and filters with great precision, including the complex filter interactions when combining registers.\n\nThe Soft B3 model is based on the B3 tone wheel organ, but without the key click and other artifacts, for a softer and more mellow sound. The Pipe model faithfully recreates a set of principal pipe organ ranks; the metal pipe registers that commonly make up the foundational sound of a pipe organ. The Pipe organ chorus mode switches to a model tuned with less precision, adding further realism to the sound.\n\nReworked from the ground up, the new vibrato and chorus captures the unique qualities of the original instruments, offering either the gentle character of a '50s B3 chorus scanner or the deep modulation of a '70s instrument.\n\nThe Bass Model section of the Nord Organ 3 provides matching bass models for all the organ types and includes a range of classic synth bass sounds, greatly expanding the sonic possibilities of the instrument. The bass can optionally be routed to a dedicated audio output, for separate treatment of organ and bass manuals on stage or in the studio.\n\nWith a brand new approach to recreating not only the classic rotary sound, but also the characteristics of both the amp and speakers, the Nord Organ 3 features an exceptional Rotary Speaker emulation with multiple microphone perspectives.\n\nChoose from three distinct Drive types capturing the various aspects of Rotary Speaker overdrive with a great deal of nuance and variation.\n\nRotor speed and acceleration rates can be customized and the Sound menu offers a wide range of settings enabling even more detailed and nuanced sound shaping.\n\nThe Fixed Stop Angle feature allows fine tuning of the exact stop position of the rotary horn.\n\nThe Nord Organ 3 offers several microphone positioning options corresponding to popular ways of reproducing the classic rotary speaker sound, both on stage and in the studio. These variations in microphone placement affect both the perceived movement as well as the tonal character of the rotary speaker, ranging from punchy and present to smooth and open.\n\nClose microphone placement gives a direct and detailed tone, while adding more distance slightly softens the treble and adds body. With microphones placed further apart, for example on the corner or even opposite sides of the cabinet, the sense of rotation becomes more apparent, creating a rich, immersive stereo image. In contrast, a tight microphone placement creates a highly focused sound with a narrower stereo field. In addition, the bass rotor has a wide setting for low end stereo effect.\n\nThe illustration below shows the selectable configurations for the Nord Organ 3 “Mic Pos” feature.\n\nThe Reverb section features 6 different types including a brand new Spring Reverb as well as Booth, Room, Stage, Hall and Cathedral options.\n\nThe Pre-Rotary setting allows the reverb to be placed before the Rotary Speaker, like a reverb equipped organ connected to a Rotary Speaker. With Pre-Rotary turned off, the reverb is placed after the Rotary Speaker emulating a room or other ambient environment.\n\nThe Delay Effect includes a vintage-style Analog mode as well as three different feedback filters for creative shaping of the delay feedback tail. Optionally, the delay can be set to Upper Manual only.\n\nThe Modulation effects include classics such as Chorus, Phaser and Flanger - all modeled on legendary hardware units - as well as Ring Modulation for a variety of creative and experimental sounds and a versatile Tremolo effect.\n\nThe Modulation effect can be assigned to the upper manual only, keeping the lower and pedal manuals clean.",
