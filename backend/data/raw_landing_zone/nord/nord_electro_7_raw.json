Carefully balanced for playability and portability, the new Kawai keybed delivers excellent responsiveness for acoustic and electric pianos.\n\nOrgan Section\n\nThe Organ Section is based on the Nord Organ 3 engine and features stunning recreations of classic tonewheel, transistor, and pipe organs as well as the latest generation of our acclaimed Rotary Speaker emulation with multiple microphone perspectives.\n\nB3\n\nThe B3 model features three different tone wheel modes ranging from the clean sound of a factory new unit to a road worn vintage character with increased tone wheel cross talk and leakage. The B3 Percussion effect includes a Poly mode, which enables polyphonic use of the Percussion even when holding chords or playing legato.\n\nVox\n\nThe iconic sound of the Vox organ has been refined even further for the Nord Electro 7, with revamped waveform shapes and filters as well as updates to both the key click and vibrato character.\n\nFarfisa\n\nThe new generation Farfisa model conveys the character of the original tone generators and filters with great precision, including the complex filter interactions when combining registers.\n\nSoft B3 and Pipe\n\nThe Soft B3 model is based on the B3 tone wheel organ, but without the key click and other artifacts, for a softer and more mellow sound. The Pipe model faithfully recreates a set of principal pipe organ ranks.\n\nVibrato and Chorus Scanner\n\nThe new vibrato and chorus captures the unique qualities of the original instruments, offering either the gentle character of a '50s B3 chorus scanner or the deep modulation of a '70s instrument.\n\nRotary Speaker emulation\n\nWith a brand new approach to recreating not only the classic rotary sound, but also the characteristics of both the amp and speakers, the Nord Electro 7 features the exceptional Rotary Speaker emulation from the Nord Organ 3.\n\nMicrophone perspectives\n\nThe Nord Electro 7 offers three microphone positioning options corresponding to popular ways of reproducing the classic rotary speaker sound, both on stage and in the studio. These variations in microphone placement affect both the perceived movement as well as the tonal character of the rotary speaker, ranging from punchy and present to smooth and open.\n\n\nThe illustration below shows the selectable configurations for the Nord Electro 7 “Mic Pos” feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Organ engine from the Nord Organ 3\nNew Rotary Speaker emulation from the Nord Organ 3\n3 mic positions for the Rotary Speaker\nB3, B3 Bass, Vox, Farfisa, Soft B3 and Pipe models\nB3 with 3 different tone wheel modes\nPiano Section\n\nThe Nord Electro 7 contains a large selection of Grands, Uprights and Electric Pianos from the exclusive Nord Piano Library along with new features such as Dynamic Compression, Unison and Timbre.
