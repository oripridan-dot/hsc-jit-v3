With its powerful panel interface and pre-programmed modulation matrix, creating unique and exciting sounds is very inspirational and quick.\n\nOverview\nSpecifications\nSounds\nDownloads\nImages & videos\nAccessories\nMain features\n\nOscillators\n\nUnique Oscillator concept\n8 Oscillator Configurations\nPitch, Detune, Shape, Sync, AM, Noise, Sub Mix, FM\nTraditional Analog and Digital Waveforms\nUnison\n\nFilter\n\n12, 24 dB low-pass filters\nHigh-pass and Band-pass filters\nTransistor and diode ladder filter simulations of Mini and TB-303\n\nModulation\n\nLFO with 5 waveforms\nMod Envelope\nLFO as additional ModEnv\n\nPerformance\n\n4-part multi-timbral\nMaster Clock Sync of Arpeggiator, LFO and Delay\nVelocity and Mod Wheel Morph\nUSB MIDI\n\nEffects\n\nEnsemble, Chorus, Phaser, Flanger, Ring Modulator, Drive\n\nSpecial features\n\nMutator\nLike Button\nExtra Fat Unison mode\nAnalog Modeling\n\nAt the heart of the Lead A1 is our new analog modeling engine. Taking our virtual analog synthesis to the next level, this modeling recreates a total analog signal path with uncanny realism, and is capable of immense sonic variety.\n\nWith 26-voice polyphony and four simultaneous synthesizer parts, the Lead A1 is a true synthesizer powerhouse that goes far beyond the current trend for limited capability analog reissues.\n\nIntuitive interface\n\nFundamental to the design of the Lead A1 is a brand new simple yet sophisticated front panel interface. The design is in fact the result of requests from professional players – even the most experienced programmers - who need to create the perfect sound as quickly as possible for today's live or studio time demands.\n\nThe Lead A1 allows easy patch creation and experimentation thanks to a new and unique oscillator section, pre-programmed modulation matrix, and simplified ADR envelopes. Dive in and create incredible patches far quicker than would normally be possible with a synthesizer of such power.\n\nOscillator Section\n\nThe Lead A1's new Oscillator section generates 47 different waveforms from classic analog to digital harmonic and inharmonic waves, whilst unique Oscillator Configuration Shortcuts make programming more immediate than ever. Start with a single Oscillator waveform select an Oscillator Configuration Shortcut - Pitch, Detune, Shape, Sync, Sub Mix, FM, AM or Noise - and use the Adjust knob to adjust the settings of the configuration.\n\nThe end result is high speed programming without the need for the usual complexity of routing and patching, and with the opportunity for ready experimentation. A fast track to stunning sound design for both advanced and less experienced programmers.\n\nOscillator Configurations\n\nPitch - adjusts the pitch of the original oscillator.\n\nDeTune - adds a second oscillator, with control over its pitch.\n\nSub Mix - adds a second oscillator, with a choice of waveform shapes and pitches.\n\nShape - The shaping of the Analog, Extended Analog and Fixed Pulse waveforms uses a traditional waveshaping method, the other waveforms are changed with a spectral shaping process.\n\nSync - emulates Hard sync by adding an additional oscillator that is the sync reference.\n\nFM - Oscillator 1 will be modulated by a sine wave from oscillator 2 at high frequencies. There are several different pitch offsets for oscillator 2 (-12 to +48 semitones).\n\nAM - uses a second oscillator to create Amplitude Modulation.\n\nNoise - adds a Noise element to the original oscillator, Osc Control sets the mix.\n\nFilter Section\n\nThe Lead A1's filter section features classic 12 and 24 dB Low Pass, a High Pass and a Band Pass filter, together with stunning emulations of the diode and ladder filters from the legendary Mini and the TB-303 synthesizers as used in the Lead 4.\n\nThe Lead A1's modeling of these filters capture the true character and response of the originals, allowing supremely flexible and precise sound design. The filters are super-smooth with a warm analog character.\n\nEffect Section\n\nThe Lead A1's effects section features two stunning brand new analog models of an Ensemble and Chorus, modeled on specific vintage synths and adding classic warmth and analog feel. Alongside these, choose from great-sounding Ring Modulation, Phaser, Flanger, or Drive per slot, and in addition a separate Delay and Reverb for each slot.\n\nMod wheel and velocity morph\n\nA classic Nord feature, the Morph function via Mod Wheel, Velocity or pedal, allows you to control multiple parameters of the Lead A1 simultaneously. Morph is exceptionally easy to set-up and use - just hold the Morph button and adjust any desired knob.\n\nArpeggiator\n\nThe Lead A1 features four separate Arpeggiators with Up/Down and Random modes and a 4-octave range. Any or all can be sync'd to the Lead A1's master clock.\n\nMaster Clock\n\nThe Master Clock function of the Lead A1 allows the LFO, Arpeggiator and Delay to be synchronized, either internally or slaved to external MIDI clock. A Tap Tempo button allows you to easily tap to the tempo of a drummer or to playback tracks.\n\nSplits and layers\n\nHaving four identical, equally powerful synthesizers at once opens breathtaking layering possibilities. The Split-mode gives you two 2 slots on each side of the split. A flexible Hold functionality lets you latch and hold slots independently in the background while playing something else on top.\n\nMulti-Focus Mode\n\nNew in the Lead A1 is the Multi-Focus Mode that allows editing and control of all four slots simultaneously. Save this mode as part of a Performance and you have live realtime control over all four slots of the Lead A1.\n\nFour outputs\n\nThe Lead A1 features four independent audio outputs with the ability to route each slot to a different output. Plus control of Pan via the front panel knob is a welcome new addition in the Lead A1.\n\nSpecial features\nLike button\n\nUnique to the Nord Lead A1 is the new 'Like' function, a simple and brilliant practical feature to use during patch creation. When programming a patch it's often not clear if it's yet perfect. Now with the Lead A1 you can simply 'Like' what you've done into a temporary location and continue editing. You can Like up to 50 variations, with the ability to scroll between them to compare your favourites or go back to a specific Liked version to edit in a different way. When you're ready, save your favourite patch or patches to the Lead A1's memory.\n\nMutator Function\n\nA popular feature of the Lead 4, the Mutator function allows variations of a patch to be created by adjusting one, some, or all elements of a patch by set percentages. There's also a wild Randomize mode to create an entirely new patch with all parameters randomized.\n\nExtra Fat Unison mode\n\nA newly designed \"Fat-As-Fat-Can-Be\" Unison Mode let's the Lead A1 challenge any vintage analog instrument.\n\nProducts\nSounds\nDownloads\nSoftware\nArtists\nAbout Us\nDistributors\nSupport\nNews\nNewsletter\nYouTube\nInstagram\nTwitter\nFacebook\nCookie settings\n\nCopyright © 2025 Clavia DMI AB.
