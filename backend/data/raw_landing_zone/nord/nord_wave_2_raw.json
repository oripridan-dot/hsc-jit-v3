The wide range of performance features and instantly tweakable hands-on effects makes the Wave 2 our most versatile performance synthesizer ever.\n\nMonitor mode\n\nThe new Monitor mode displays your settings for Amp Envelope and Filters in the Program display for better overview and control.\n\nLayer Section\n\nThe Wave 2 features a Program Layer section with faders for easily controlling the volume or pan for all 4 layer parts at once. The Layer section also provides handy features for quick layer focus, pan control, solo and multi-editing. \n\nThe Split mode offers three split points providing up to 4 zones with optional crossfades. The flexible Hold functionality lets you latch and hold slots independently in the background while playing something else on top.\n\nGroup Mode \n\nThe new Group feature allows you to group 2, 3 or 4 layers and lets them share the same Filter, Envelope, Arpeggiator, LFO and Effect-settings - perfect when creating complex multi-layered sounds that can be edited as one coherent sound.\n\nOscillator Section\n\nThe Oscillator section for each of the 4 layers offers 4 modes: Analog, Wavetable, FM and Samples and is easily browsed with our new direct category mode. The Oscillator Control features additional control over shape, sync or detune.\n\nOscillator categories\n\nAnalog: an extensive range of waveforms from classic analog to extended, harmonically rich new additions.\n\nBasic: Saw, Pulse, Pulse Width, Sine, Square with basic tuning controls.\nShape: Waveforms where Osc Control will alter the Shape of the waveform\nMulti: 2 or more waveforms combined where the Osc Control will adjust amount of detune and spread\nSync: Soft and Hard synced configurations, where Osc Control controls Sync Frequency\nNoise: White noise\n\nSamples: include high-quality samples from our Nord Sample Library 3.0 as well as the possibility to add your own custom samples using the Nord Sample Editor 3. Use the embedded sample presets for instantly playable dynamic sounds or sculpt your own sound from scratch with the \"Raw Samp\" mode.\n\nWavetable: A large number of advanced wavetables covering a wide range of tonal characteristics.\n\nFM 2, 3 and 4 operator configurations with harmonic and inharmonic variations.\n\nUnison\n\nThe Wave 2 features a powerful multi-oscillator Unison effect with true Superwaves simultaneously generating hundreds of waveforms for extremely thick and fat sounds.\n\nCompatible with Nord Sample Library\n\nThe Sample section comes loaded with a wide selection of quality samples including Strings, Brass, Guitars, Choirs, Chromatic Percussion as well as the exclusively licensed sounds of the legendary Mellotron and Chamberlin. All sounds are easily replaceable using the Nord Sound Manager.\n\nCreate and transfer your own samples\n\nAdding your own custom sample instruments has never been easier thanks to the new streamlined Nord Sample Editor 3 for Mac and Windows that lets you map, loop and transfer samples to your Nord Wave 2 in a breeze.\n\nFilter Section\n\nThe Filter section has 6 Filter types featuring classic 12 and 24 dB Low Pass, a High Pass, High Pass/Low Pass and a Band Pass filter, together with a stunning emulation of the transistor ladder filter from the legendary Mini.\n\nThe unique modeling of these filters captures the true character and response of the classic analog instruments, allowing for flexible and precise sound design. The Filter section is equippied with full ADSR envelope. \n\nLFO & modulation Section\n\nThe Wave 2 features a dedicated LFO for each layer with a choice of waveforms plus AD/AR Modulation Envelope with dedicated velocity setting and Invert mode. The LFO has several morphable parameters and the rate can be synchronized to the Master Clock. \n\nAmp envelope\n\nThe Amp Section is equipped with a full ADSR envelope featuring a powerful new Transient Attack mode for adding more punch to your sounds.\n\nMorphing & Impulse Morph\n\nThe Wave 2 features an extensive range of morphable parameters that can be controlled from four different sources: Velocity, Aftertouch, Wheel and Control Pedal. All morph sources can be quickly assigned to control multiple parameters simultaneously and the powerful Impulse Morph feature lets you instantly change any parameter of your sound.\n\nWheel assign \n\nInstantly assign LFO, Oscillator Control or Filter to the Modulation Wheel.\n\nAdvanced Arpeggiator\n\nThe Nord Wave 2 is truly a rhythmical powerhouse with both a classic arpeggiator and a polyphonic mode with directly editable patterns.\n\nPolyphonic mode\n\nThe Poly mode is a polyphonic Arpeggiator that will retrig all held keys either straight or patterned featuring different inversions for exciting harmonic variations.\n\nGate mode\n\nThe brand new Gate mode chops your sound up in a rhythmic pattern with adjustable depth.\n\nPattern mode\n\nThe Pattern mode contains a wide selection of Rhythmic Patterns allows easy editing for creating your own custom patterns. \n\nMaster clock\n\nThe Master Clock of the Wave 2 allows the LFO, Arpeggiator and various effects to be synchronized, either internally or by an external MIDI clock. With Master Clock synchronization you can synchronize 4 layers with individual patterns, all perfectly in sync with Delays and LFO's. A Tap Tempo allows you to easily tap to the tempo of a drummer or to playback tracks.\n\nEffect Section\n\nA separate Effect section for each layer featuring a great selection of instantly tweakable high quality stereo effects modelled after classic stomp boxes.\n\nModulation Effects\n\nTremolo, Pan, Ring Modulator, Chorus, Ensemble and Vibe effects with Rate and Amount control. All effects are controllable via Control Pedal (or other Morph sources) and can also be synchronized to the Master Clock for rhythmic effects.\n\nEQ & Drive\n\nEQ with Bass and Treble control - or 1 Band Sweepable EQ. A sparkling Tube Drive emulation is also available.\n\nDelay\n\nAdvanced stereo Delay effect with Ping Pong mode, Analog Mode and Tap Tempo. New features include creative new Feedback options for adding Ensemble, Chorus, Vibe as well as HP/LP and BP filter in the Feedback loop.\n\nReverb\n\nThe Reverb section has five different Reverb sizes (Booth, Room, Stage, Hall and new Cathedral) for adding some ambience to your sounds, and the amount is now morphable. New features include Bright and Dark modes for either extended or reduced treble. The new Chorale effect adds a lush modulation effect.\n\nProducts\nSounds\nDownloads\nSoftware\nArtists\nAbout Us\nDistributors\nSupport\nNews\nNewsletter\nYouTube\nInstagram\nTwitter\nFacebook\nCookie settings\n\nCopyright © 2025 Clavia DMI AB.
