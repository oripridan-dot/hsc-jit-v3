New features include integrated multi-pad, Reverb and Delay effects, a simplified sound selection mode and new Sound Banks for quickly creating custom kits on the fly.\n\nOverview\nSpecifications\nSounds\nDownloads\nImages & videos\nAccessories\nMain features\n6-channel Modeling Percussion Synthesizer\nIntegrated multipad, kick pad input and MIDI\nSimplified user interface with easy sound selection\nNew preset 'Drum Select' library for kicks, snares, toms and more\nAdvanced sound engine with Resonant Synthesis, Subtractive synthesis and FM-synthesis\nReverb and Delay Effects - adjustable amount for each pad\nDrive, Sample-Rate reduction, Ring Modulation and EQ-effects for each pad\nMIDI in/out and full CC-control\nStereo Output with improved output level\nHeadphone Output with improved output level\nSound selection\n\nThe Drum Select feature lets you browse a wide selection of great sounding drums sounds, simply assigned to each pad individually. Easily replace toms, cymbals or kicks in seconds by selecting from our new preset library.\n\nThe Drum Select banks feature 9 categories of great preset sounds that can be easily assigned to any of the six pads/channels - and is a great starting point in rehearsal situations when you need to find the right sounds in a matter of seconds.\n\nThe categories include Bass drums, Snare drums, Toms, Hi-hats, Cymbals, Percussion, Bells, Tuned Percussion and Effects.\n\nSound creation\n\nThe Sound generation takes place in the three sections Tone, Noise and Click. The sounds of the Nord Drum 3P are all synthesized in real-time - allowing you to both sculpt and play sounds with a unique dynamic response, regardless if you prefer to play with drum sticks or from a sequencer.\n\nTone Section\n\nThe Tone Section is specialized for creating tonal and harmonically complex sound spectras and has four synthesis modes – Resonant synthesis, Subtractive Synthesis, Frequency Modulation and Ring Modulation synthesis.\n\nThe Resonant synthesis mode offers a wide range of complex spectras inspired by materials like drum heads, marimba, vibraphone, tines and cymbals. A unique feature includes the possibility to tune harmonic spectra.\n\nThe Subtractive Wave types include Sine, Saw, Square, Pulse waveforms and T-Bridge Oscillators and are brilliant for creating classic synth-type drum sounds and effects.\n\nThe FM Synthesis mode features 6 different FM algorithms where the Frequency parameter controls modulation amount and Spectra controls modulation frequency.\n\nThe Ring Modulation mode features 2 different types of Ring Modulation. \n\nDynamic control\n\nThe Nord Drum 3P offers great control over the dynamic response of the harmonic spectras. When using Resonant synthesis waveforms the upper parts of the harmonic spectra be controlled with velocity, giving it a brighter timbre when played hard.\n\nWhen using the Subtractive synthesis mode, the Frequency parameter controls the cut-off frequency of a Low-Pass filter and the Dyn Filter controls how much the filter should respond to velocity .\n\nThe Decay controls the decay of the whole spectra, with a choice of Linear and Exponential decay envelopes. A Dynamic Decay mode lets you set different Decay lengths for soft and hard strokes. The Punch Decay adds more attack to the Tone by giving the fundamental pitch an ultra-fast envelope at the very beginning of the sound.\n\nThe Bend parameter provides a powerful, velocity sensitive pitch envelope. Use it to create attack-like effects but also more radical bending sounds that travel up or down when played such as the sound of a raindrop, tablas or the classic 80’s “pioouw” tom-sound.\n\nNoise Section\n\nThe Noise section is all about producing noise and is very powerful. Create anything from silky smooth hiss to gritty gravel to give the Tone part of the sound more texture.\n\nThe Noise can be sculpted with Low-Pass, High-Pass or Band-Pass filters with Cut-Off and Resonance controls. Once you've found the noise of your choice, it can be adjusted to respond dynamically to velocity in the same manner as with the Tone section with the Dyn Filter control.\n\nThe Decay control is just as powerful, with a choice of Linear, Exponential and Gated decay types. A Dynamic Decay mode lets you set different Decay lengths for soft and hard strokes.\n\nCombine this with the equally powerful dynamic controls of the Tone Section and it won’t take long before realizing the potential for creating complex sounds with fascinating material-like behaviors! \n\nClick Section\n\nThe Click-section is a specialized section for an ultra-short attack to the sound. A wide range of different click types are available as well as a level control for finding the sweet spot where the Click merges with the other elements and becomes one coherent sound.\n\nEffects\n\nEach of the 6 channels of the Nord Drum 3P has its own powerful effects – Drive, EQ and Ring Modulation. Adding just a touch of Drive to your sounds can make a huge difference in terms of realism, while the Sample-Rate reduction is perfect for Lo-fi crackling effects. Ring Modulation can be used for slow tremolo-like effects to total atonal mayhem.\n\nA flexible parametric Equalizer with selectable band and amount is also available for each channel, brilliant for adding some finish or attitude to your sounds.\n\nThe Nord Drum 3 features two new Master Effects, Reverb and Delay. The Reverb features 5 room algorithms (Tiled Room, Room, Plate, Stage and Hall) with controls for tonal color. The Delay effect features a Tap Tempo-mode and adjustable feedback amount. The amount of Reverb and Delay can be set individually for each of the 6 channels of the Nord Drum 3P.\n\nSpecial features\nMute Group\n\nThe Mute Group gives you the option to create sounds that can cancel each other out. Only one of the members of the group can sound at a time, and can be used for creating a close/open hi-hat behavior and emulating muting techniques from hand percussion.\n\nScale Presets\n\nTuned Percussion kits can be created instantly by selecting one of the Scale Presets, which include Chord Scales, Pentatonic, Hang Tunings and Hexatonic.\n\nEdit All\n\nThe handy Edit All mode let’s you edit all 6 channels simultaneously, for example reverb, distortion or delay.\n\nMiscellaneous\nMIDI\n\nMIDI in/out is also available for using the Nord Drum 3P with any kind of MIDI pads or sequence it from an external MIDI Sequencer. All of the Nord Drum 3P sound parameters can be controlled via CC-controls over MIDI. If you own an iPad don't miss our free iPad app Nord Beat, specifically designed for sequencing the Nord Drum 3P via MIDI.\n\nMixer\n\nThe Channel Mixer sets the level for each channel and also features a Pan control for creating a lush stereo image. If you like to send the kick to a separate output, just pan that channel all the way to the left and the other channels to the right.\n\nTrigger interface\n\nEverything you play when using the multipads and external input is automatically output to the MIDI output, making the Nord Drum 3 a brilliant controller for other sound sources via MIDI.\n\nProducts\nSounds\nDownloads\nSoftware\nArtists\nAbout Us\nDistributors\nSupport\nNews\nNewsletter\nYouTube\nInstagram\nTwitter\nFacebook\nCookie settings\n\nCopyright © 2025 Clavia DMI AB.
