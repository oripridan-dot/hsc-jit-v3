      "description": "Colorful Tones, Portable Design\n\nPlayers everywhere love the GX-100 for its streamlined design, free-flowing interface, and high-quality tones. Armed with the core GX-100 engine, the compact GX-10 brings you the same inspiring experience in an even more portable footprint. You get loads of AIRD amps and effects for covering every style, plus speedy sound building with the intuitive color touch display and panel knobs. Adding in multi-mode footswitches, an integrated expression pedal, and USB audio connectivity, the GX-10 seamlessly transitions from nightly stage performing to desktop recording, song creation, and daily practice sessions.\n\n*Compatibility with all third-party devices and software is not guaranteed.\n\nDownload “BTS for GX-10” for iOS\nDownload “BTS for GX-10” for Android\nDownload “BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-10” for Windows/macOS\n\nThe GX-10 brings you a universe of ultra-responsive BOSS tone processing in a travel-ready size. Take on every playing situation with 23 guitar amps and nine bass amps, including high-gain X-Ultra, X-Optima, and X-Titan types crafted with our latest technologies. And let your imagination run wild with 170 effects, including overdrives and distortions, mod effects, delays, and reverbs, plus dedicated bass effects and BOSS classics like Slow Gear, Octave, Slicer, and more.\n\nThe GX-10 enables fast sound creation with its inviting color touch display and four dynamic parameter knobs. Assign up to two amps and 15 effects in each memory. Create serial or parallel effect routings and change the order by dragging blocks with a finger on the screen. And patch in your go-to external pedals with the send/return loop. BOSS Tone Studio takes things even further, allowing you to edit sounds and load IRs from your computer or wirelessly tweak tones via our optional Bluetooth adaptor and the mobile version of the app.\n\nPacking clever control options into a minimal layout, the GX-10 gives you powerful tools for real-time sound adjustment while performing. Versatile control modes provide maximum flexibility with just three footswitches. The expression pedal toggles between volume and wah and activates the tuner when you pull the pedal back. But you can customize it to control nearly anything you want with the GX-10’s assign matrix.\n\nUp/Down Mode—Simplify your rig by scrolling through memories one at a time. Set up basic memories for clean, crunch rhythm, and lead sounds. Or load up the 66 banks and 198 user memories with custom sounds for your set list and tap through them sequentially on stage.\n\nManual Mode—This reconfigures the footswitches to control three user-assignable targets. Use them like a pedalboard to turn effects on/off or kick in a solo boost. Or go deeper by changing up to 20 assignable parameters with just one press.\n\nBank/Number Mode—This mode allows you to select memories within banks. It also unlocks the Current Number function, providing access to one or more parameters by pressing the switch for the currently loaded memory. Using this function, you can extend your tonal options for each memory with a solo boost, delay effect, or anything else you’d like to assign.\n\nIn addition to editing, BOSS Tone Studio allows you to organize GX-10 sounds into Livesets for different gigs and playing situations. You can also access BOSS Tone Exchange within the app to download professionally created sounds and share GX-10 Livesets with the global BOSS community. GX-100 Livesets are fully compatible with the GX-10 as well. In addition, there’s a built-in USB-C audio interface for capturing high-quality guitar tones in music production apps on computers and mobile devices.\n\nBOSS multi-effects combine a full arsenal of tones, effects, and amp models into a single, streamlined unit, offering a flexible alternative to traditional pedalboard setups.Read more…\n\nAn exciting world of effects awaits keyboardists from rotary, chorus, flanging, and phasing to reverb, delay, distortion, loopers, and more.Read more…\n\nGX is the latest addition to the comprehensive BOSS range of multi-effects processors, offering extreme flexibility with intuitive control.Read more…\n\nHigh-quality footswitch cap for select BOSS products.\n\nCarrying case for the BOSS GX-10, GT-1, and GT-1B.\n\nDurable metal footswitch available in latching and unlatching types.\n*Some products are compatible with either FS-5U or FS-5L only. Please check the specs to confirm the suitable model.\n\nTwo switches in one, BOSS’s FS-6 combines latch- and momentary-type switching into one unit.\n\nCompact, multifunctional dual footswitch for remote control of effect pedals or amp channel switching.\n\nSmooth and precise expression control in a pedalboard-friendly size.\n\nTank-tough diecast volume pedals with high/low impedance option.\n\nDurable expression pedal for use with keyboards or other Expression-compatible instruments to control a range of functions and effects parameters.\n\nCompact adaptor that brings Bluetooth wireless capabilities to compatible BOSS and Roland products.\n\nPowerful MIDI expression pedal for controlling devices through Bluetooth MIDI, USB, and TRS MIDI outputs.\n\nCustomizable Bluetooth foot controller for software applications and MIDI hardware.\n\nStraight to right-angle 1/4-inch connectors, 10 ft./3 m length. Available in black (BIC-10A-BK), orange (BIC-10A-OR), yellow (BIC-10A-YL), green (BIC-10A-GN), red (BIC-10A-RD), and blue (BIC-10A-BU).\n\nIf you have questions about operating your BOSS product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support department by phone or email.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "Industry-Leading Tone with Breakthrough BOSS Technology\n\nDelivering unmatched sound quality and musical expression, the GT-1000 ushers in a new era of performance in amp/effects processors for guitar and bass. This premium tone machine features our groundbreaking AIRD (Augmented Impulse Response Dynamics) technology, realized with decades of BOSS research and class-leading 32-bit/96 kHz processing. There’s also a huge range of BOSS effects, complete with ultra-flexible routing options and deep real-time control. And with built-in Bluetooth®, you can tweak settings wirelessly from your mobile device via the dedicated BTS app. Packing immense power in a streamlined pro design, the GT-1000 is a game changer that brings new levels of creative expression to players everywhere.\n\nFor optimal performance, stay up to date with the current GT-1000 system software and BOSS Tone Studio.\n\nDownload “BTS for GT-1000” for iOS\nDownload “BTS for GT-1000” for Android\nDownload “BOSS TONE STUDIO for GT-1000” for Windows/macOS\n\nThe GT-1000 brings you no-compromise audio performance backed by the latest BOSS technologies. It’s the first-ever guitar multi-effects unit with 32-bit AD/DA, 32-bit floating-point processing, and 96 kHz sampling rate throughout, while the custom DSP engine packs over three times the power of previous generations. This immense processing muscle unlocks far greater sonic detail than ever before possible, making it easy to get the sounds you’re after without endless parameter tweaks and microscopic EQ adjustments.\n\nThe GT-1000 harnesses BOSS’s breakthrough AIRD technology for a new level of performance, flexibility, and usability, offering consistent and reliable response in every playing scenario. Your sounds flow smoothly into any creative setup, providing great tone and natural tube amp feel with minimal adjustments. A large selection of AIRD Output Select types tailor the sound for any destination, whether it’s a guitar amp input, a power amp driving guitar speakers, or a full-range monitoring system—or all of them at once. AIRD is fully integrated into the GT-1000 amps at every level, so you’ll always experience their authentic sound and response, no matter what you’re plugged into.\n\nThe GT-1000 features a wide range of BOSS original amplifiers suitable for all guitar styles, from super-clean to ultra-heavy. Several amp types employ MDP (Multi-Dimensional Processing) technology for dynamic, nuanced tone that reaches beyond the capabilities of analog designs. Classic tube amps throughout history are also included, from coveted vintage combos to modern high-gain heads. Two amps can be used at once in a single patch, allowing you to switch between two sounds, blend amps for complex tones, or achieve big, expansive sound in stereo setups.\n\nThe GT-1000 comes loaded with all types of effects, from BOSS classics and retro stompboxes to modern effects driven by MDP and other advanced technologies. Multiple series and parallel routings are easy to set up via the intuitive interface. And with the clever Stompbox feature, you can adjust commonly used amp and effects settings across multiple patches at once. There are also two effects loops for patching in your favorite external effects and preamps.\n\nThe GT-1000 takes bass processing to new heights with next-generation sound quality and ultra-flexible performance features. A variety of AIRD bass preamps are on hand for shaping your core tone, while eight different overdrive/distortion effects are available for additional color and gain. There’s an MDP bass compressor as well, plus chorus, flanger, touch wah, and many other effect types specially tuned for bass.\n\nWith its ten footswitches and expression pedal with toe switch, the GT-1000 provides comprehensive creative control wherever you play. And you can go even deeper with external switches, pedals, MIDI, and USB. The onboard controls come with default assignments for preset selection and per-patch control targets, but you can easily reassign them to operate nearly any function. Manual and Pedalboard modes are also available to instantly reconfigure the footswitches for additional control in the heat of the moment.\n\nThe GT-1000 features a multi-channel USB audio/MIDI interface for flexible computer recording and efficient re-amping. Edit sounds remotely with the BOSS Tone Studio app, either via USB on a computer or wirelessly from your mobile device. And use the dedicated IR loader software to expand your tone options with 16 of your favorite speaker cab IRs.\n\nThe Version 4.0 update brings even more creative features to the GT-1000 platform, including three newly developed high-gain guitar amp types that spotlight the continuing evolution of our advanced AIRD and MDP technologies:\n\nX-Ultra—Inspired by a classic British stack amp modified with a modern multi-stage gain circuit. MDP provides intelligent control of the clipping in each gain stage, realizing extended dynamic response that’s not possible with traditional analog designs.\n\nX-Optima—With many high-gain tube amplifiers, it can be difficult to strike the ideal tonal balance between chords and single notes. X-Optima features an innovative new gain algorithm that takes full advantage of MDP’s adaptive frequency shaping, providing well-defined rhythm sounds and rich lead tones that sit perfectly in every mix.\n\nX-Titan—This articulate amp type is perfect for aggressive metal styles driven by heavy riffs. MDP delivers sharp, tight sounds on the low strings while retaining fatness and body in the high ranges, making it well-suited for down tunings and extended-range guitars with seven or eight strings.\n\nThe update also includes six new bass preamps, two new drive effects, and more.\n\nLearn more about the GT-1000 Version 4.0 update.\n\nWill Sergeant talks Echo & the Bunnymen’s iconic guitar tones, Roland and BOSS gear, and how he’s shaped the post-punk sound since 1978.Read more…\n\nFrom dub to punk to electronic, Gorillaz’s touring bass player relies on the BOSS GT-1000 Guitar Effects Processor for his seismic low end.Read more…\n\nBOSS multi-effects combine a full arsenal of tones, effects, and amp models into a single, streamlined unit, offering a flexible alternative to traditional pedalboard setups.Read more…\n\nExplore key features, functionality, and learning resources to get the most out of the GT series.Read more…\n\nLearn how the BOSS V-Guitar System can streamline your setup and expand your creative possibilities onstage with powerful processing.Read more…\n\nThe shred virtuoso talks about the power of songwriting, her social media success, and stamping out separation, misogyny, and sexism.Read more…\n\nThe popularity of guitar impulse response (IR) and cabinet simulator pedals has led to exciting tonal options for guitarists.Read more…\n\nGiving you a head start on using the GT-1000 to unlock your full creativity.Read more…\n\nJanek Gwizdala kindly introduces the new GT-1000 for bass and summarizes the newly added features.\n\nSam Bell introduces the newly added features with the BOSS GT-1000 Version 3 update.\n\nPlease check 15 newly added presets on GT-1000 version 3 specially tuned for bass.

      "description": "Timeless Effects, Infinite Inspiration\n\nThe PX-1 Plugout FX is an innovative hardware platform that captures the timeless BOSS compact pedal experience in one versatile pedal. This convertible stomp holds multiple authentic effect recreations from the historic BOSS lineup, providing endless fuel for every creative journey. With the PX-1 in your setup, exploring the vast and influential world of BOSS compact pedals has never been easier.\n\nFor optimal performance, stay up to date with the current PX-1 system software.\n\nDownload “BOSS Effect Loader” for iOS\nDownload “BOSS Effect Loader” for Android\n\nSince 1977, BOSS compact pedals have inspired generations of musicians around the world. Over 140 unique models have been produced, over 19 million units have been sold, and many have remained in non-stop production for decades. From vintage classics and go-to workhorses to rare and specialty effects, the PX-1 puts the diverse BOSS compact pedal range at your command.\n\nBacked by newly developed BOSS algorithms, each effect in the PX-1 delivers the authentic sound and response of the pedal it’s based on. Every detail is modeled with stunning accuracy, thanks to a powerful DSP engine dedicated to recreating the sound of a single effect at a time. Dial in tones fast with the familiar knob interface you’re used to with BOSS compacts, supported by an onboard display for current parameters and internal settings.\n\nThe PX-1 supports external control with one or two footswitches or an expression pedal. Use the Swap function to switch between two effects. Or assign nearly any parameter for real-time expressive control while performing. Stereo I/O provides flexible connectivity and enhanced sound for models that support stereo operation, while tap tempo and MIDI clock sync help you get the most out of time-based effects.\n\nThe PX-1’s permanent library features eight famous BOSS pedals, including the three models from the 1977 debut and iconic drive pedals like the DS-1 and SD-1. Every model has a “1” designation, indicating that it’s the first of its type within the BOSS timeline.\n\nThe OD-1 invented the now ubiquitous “overdrive” category in stompbox effects. Designed with an asymmetrical clipping circuit that reproduces the pleasing sound of a driven tube amp, this yellow classic dishes up warm, fat tones rich with even-order harmonics.\n\nThis unique and rare BOSS effect boosts a single frequency band determined by the Spectrum control. It’s great for many tone-shaping applications, such as adding presence to solo lines, boosting the character of overdrive and distortion pedals, and creating nasal “cocked wah” lead tones.\n\nThe PH-1 produces a mild phaser sound with a full low-end response. Skillful engineering allows you to dial in a range of musical tones with a simple two-knob interface.\n\nThis well-loved BOSS original reshapes the note attack to create violin-like swell tones. The SG-1 is particularly effective when crafting ambient sounds with delays and reverbs.\n\nThe first BOSS compressor pedal has a distinctly different circuit than the later CS-2 and CS-3 models. It features an optical design with a photocoupler, which offers a slower attack with a unique character.\n\nThe TW-1 provides a classic wah effect that’s controlled by the input signal level. Two controls adjust the sensitivity and depth of the input filter.\n\nThe workhorse SD-1 has been the core gain pedal for generations of players across every musical genre. Expanding on the OD-1 design with enhanced voicing and a tone control, this essential stomp is packed with highly musical overdrive colors.\n\nThe DS-1 is the top-selling BOSS compact pedal ever. Its original, unchanged design delivers a hard-edged attack and smooth sustain, making it a player’s staple for nearly four decades.\n\nThe following eight effects are also included with the PX-1, and you can load them into the pedal’s eight user locations. After registering your pedal with a free Roland Account, download the effects into the PX-1 using the BOSS Effect Loader app.\n\nThe CE-2 distilled the sound of the CE-1 Chorus Ensemble—the first BOSS pedal and the world’s first chorus effect—into the smaller compact pedal format. Tuned for mono operation and a lighter modulation sound than the CE-1, this signature BOSS original has defined the guitar tones on countless hits from the 1980s to the present day.\n\nIn production for over 20 years, the original BF-2 hardware featured a unique analog design based around a single BBD chip. This versatile effect produces an array of warm modulated tones, from metallic and phase-shifted textures to soft chorus and wavering vibrato.\n\nThe PN-2 combines tremolo and panning effects in one design. Tremolo mode produces a tighter amplitude modulation effect than traditional circuits, while Pan mode moves the audio signal across the stereo field. Triangle and square wave shapes are available for different sound characteristics.\n\nThe original OC-2 hardware was a pioneer in octave pedals, producing touch-responsive tones with an all-analog circuit and a unique method of phase inversion. The OC-2 works great for adding mono octave sounds to any instrument, and it’s legendary among bassists for its ability to create synth-like sub-bass tones.\n\nThe PS-2 brought continuous pitch shifting to the compact pedal format in 1987, and the effect remains popular for its retro 8-bit processing and vintage digital character. Three pitch modes include a manual option for fine-tuning the pitch over two octaves and presets for one octave up and one octave down. The PS-2 also includes three delay modes with time ranges from 30 ms to two full seconds.\n\nThis underground BOSS classic produces warm, characterful tones with mild pitch fluctuations and dynamic control of the modulation onset with the Rise Time function. In addition to standard toggle operation for the pedal switch, a special Unlatch mode adds the effect only when holding the switch.\n\nReleased in 1983, the DD-2 hardware was the world’s first digital delay in stompbox form. Created in the early days of digital music technology, the DD-2 is still loved for its warm 12-bit tones that sit perfectly in the mix.\n\nCompared with the DS-1 Distortion, the DF-2 offers higher gain and a smoother attack character. Its secret weapon is the feedbacker function, which lets you enjoy the sustained harmonic feedback of a cranked amp at any volume, including practice sessions with headphones. Hold the pedal switch or an external footswitch to punctuate performances with this expressive tone as you play.\n\nMany more PX-1 effects will be added over time, and each new effect will be available with a low-cost Model Pass within the BOSS Effect Loader app.\n\nThe same PX-1 effects are also available for computer music production with the BOSS Effects Pedals plug-in on Roland Cloud, and six months of Roland Cloud Ultimate membership comes with the pedal. This gives you complete access to the full BOSS Effects Pedals library, JC-120 Jazz Chorus and RE-201 Space Echo plug-ins, and many other powerful creative tools.\n\nLearn More About Roland Cloud\nLearn More About the BOSS Effects Pedals Plug-In\n\n*Pricing varies per region.\n\nExplore the world of classic BOSS pedals—now reborn as DAW-ready plug-ins—and find out how you can bring timeless tone to your tracks.Read more…\n\nThe PX-1 Plugout FX is an innovative hardware platform that captures the timeless BOSS compact pedal experience in one versatile pedal.\n\nChris Booth kindly introduces the tones of 16 starter models.\n\nCompact, multifunctional dual footswitch for remote control of effect pedals or amp channel switching.\n\nTwo switches in one, BOSS’s FS-6 combines latch- and momentary-type switching into one unit.\n\nDurable metal footswitch available in latching and unlatching types.\n*Some products are compatible with either FS-5U or FS-5L only.
