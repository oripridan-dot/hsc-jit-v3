      "description": "Your Ultimate Bass Companion\n\nThe GX-1B delivers professional-grade sound and features in an ultra-portable platform for practice, recording, and performance. Premium bass-tuned amps and effects supply endless creative fuel, while the high-res color display, intuitive effect buttons, and Gear Suite tools make sound creation a snap. Rugged, powerful, and remarkably compact, the GX-1B is filled with inspiring tones for every bassist, from beginning players to touring pros seeking an all-in-one travel solution with no-compromise sound.\n\n*Compatibility with all third-party devices and software is not guaranteed.\n\nDownload “BTS for GX-1B” for iOS\nDownload “BTS for GX-1B” for Android\nDownload “BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-1B” for Windows/macOS\n\nThe GX-1B captures decades of our bass-focused sound development in one versatile processor. Explore 16 highly expressive AIRD amps, complemented by over 130 effects from the vast BOSS library. With adjustable effect order and eight simultaneous blocks plus a volume pedal and noise suppressor, you can easily craft custom setups for playing different music styles and performing specific songs on stage.\n\nWhether editing presets or building sounds from scratch, the GX-1B is designed for frustration-free creation. Inspired by the GX-100 and GX-10 interfaces, the hexagon-shaped effect buttons provide a visual representation of the sound categories, and you can use them to turn effects on/off with a tap or access detailed parameters with a long press. You also get 99 memories loaded with ready-to-play presets, plus 99 user memories for storing your custom sound creations.\n\nThe GX-1B introduces Gear Suite, a powerful new feature for dialing in amp and effect sounds fast. Each amp/effect type contains multiple factory Gear Suite settings, letting you recall a complete set of professionally tuned parameters with the turn of a knob. You can also edit effect parameters to taste and save favorites in user Gear Suite locations for instant access to personalized settings.\n\nOnce you’ve crafted your tones, grow your expressive range on stage with advanced real-time control. Assign the onboard footswitches and expression pedal to control anything you can imagine—from basic effects on/off to adjusting one or more parameter targets at once—and go even further with wired and wireless options for external control. The GX-1B also offers three flexible power options (batteries, AC adaptor, or USB), allowing you to practice and perform anywhere.\n\nThe GX-1B flows wherever your creativity takes you. Interface with a mobile device or computer via Bluetooth or USB to jam with songs and record tracks in a DAW. When you’re ready to dive deeper, BOSS Tone Studio is your ideal partner. Use the Session feature to play along with YouTube songs and lessons, complete with AB repeat and speed adjustment. Hone your skills with a metronome and rhythms. And access BOSS Tone Exchange within the app to stay inspired with pro sounds. Editing tools are also on hand to fine-tune effects and organize sounds for later recall.\n\nHigh-quality footswitch cap for select BOSS products.\n\nStraight to right-angle 1/4-inch connectors, 10 ft./3 m length. Available in black (BIC-10A-BK), orange (BIC-10A-OR), yellow (BIC-10A-YL), green (BIC-10A-GN), red (BIC-10A-RD), and blue (BIC-10A-BU).\n\nCompact, multifunctional dual footswitch for remote control of effect pedals or amp channel switching.\n\nTwo switches in one, BOSS’s FS-6 combines latch- and momentary-type switching into one unit.\n\nDurable metal footswitch available in latching and unlatching types.\n*Some products are compatible with either FS-5U or FS-5L only. Please check the specs to confirm the suitable model.\n\nSmooth and precise expression control in a pedalboard-friendly size.\n\nTank-tough diecast volume pedals with high/low impedance option.\n\nDurable expression pedal for use with keyboards or other Expression-compatible instruments to control a range of functions and effects parameters.\n\nPowerful MIDI expression pedal for controlling devices through Bluetooth MIDI, USB, and TRS MIDI outputs.\n\nCustomizable Bluetooth foot controller for software applications and MIDI hardware.\n\nCarrying case for the BOSS GX-10, GT-1, and GT-1B.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your BOSS product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support department by phone or email.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "Unrivaled Dynamic Pitch Expression\n\nThe XS-100 Poly Shifter redefines pedal-based pitch shifting with groundbreaking BOSS technology years in the making. Delivering natural sound, precision tracking, and deep customization options, this powerhouse expression machine transforms how you perform with pitch. Glide up or down four full octaves with the ultra-smooth pedal to infuse your music with evocative new colors. Enhance solos by triggering bold shifts with a single footswitch press. Instantly retune your instrument with drop tunings, capo simulations, and more. And with onboard memories, your favorite setups are always ready when you need them.\n\nIn developing the XS series, BOSS engineers pioneered new methods to advance real-time pitch shifting and eliminate the tonal artifacts common in conventional designs. Powered by finely tuned algorithms and a specially selected DSP platform, the XS-100 provides balanced polyphonic performance that feels natural and musical across all playing styles, pickup positions, and pedal setups. Your instrument’s attack and tonal character are fully preserved, and even complex chords and sustained lead tones—typically a challenge for pitch shifters—are reproduced with stunning clarity.\n\nWith the XS-100 underfoot, you’re in full command of nearly any pitch effect imaginable. The responsive pedal offers linear control of four octaves up or down, and independent pitch-change speeds for each pedal direction make it easy to produce motor revving tones and other interesting effects. At the end of the pedal’s travel, you can use the integrated toe switch to introduce momentary pitch jumps with adjustable range and rise/fall time. Two footswitches are also available to bypass the pedal shift and quickly retune your instrument at fixed semitone steps across eight octaves.\n\nThe XS-100 gives you the tools to shape pitch effects with precision and personality. Customize the pedal’s range for different songs or techniques and fine-tune the response curve to suit your playing style. Freely reassign the toe switch and footswitches to alternate functions. Craft rich doubling effects with the detuning option and explore many other ways to refine your sound. Once everything’s dialed in, save your setup to one of 30 memories for instant recall during live sets or studio sessions.\n\nFilled with flexible connectivity, the XS-100 flows with every performance setup. Up to two external footswitches or an expression pedal are supported, expanding your real-time control options. MIDI I/O opens the door to more advanced applications, from external MIDI control to sending MIDI commands with the pedal and footswitches. There’s also a secondary output that mirrors the input signal, providing parallel routing flexibility for sophisticated rigs.\n\nHow BOSS mastered the three As of pitch shifting—Attack, Authenticity, Accuracy—with the XS-1 and XS-100, setting new industry standards.Read more…\n\nDiscover what pitch shifter pedals do, how they work, and why they’re essential tools for guitarists seeking new tones and creative freedom.Read more…\n\nExplore decades of industry-leading BOSS pitch pedal innovation, from the classic OC-2 Octave to the advanced XS-1 and XS-100 Poly Shifters.Read more…\n\nWatch inspiring demo videos and discover new techniques on how to transform your music-making with the BOSS OC-5, PS-6, XS-1, and XS-100.Read more…\n\nA clear guide to the complete BOSS pitch range—learn how the XS-1, XS-100, OC-5, and PS-6 can reshape your sound and inspire new ideas.Read more…\n\nThe London-based guitarist walks us through his history, the power of the XS-100 Poly Shifter, and how he'd explain his style to his granny.Read more…\n\nHigh-quality footswitch cap for select BOSS products.\n\nStraight to right-angle 1/4-inch connectors, 10 ft./3 m length.

      "description": "Rapid Retuning, Flawless Sound\n\nThe XS-1 Poly Shifter delivers instant retuning in a convenient, compact footprint. Driven by advanced BOSS algorithms years in the making, this magical pedal transforms the overall pitch while maintaining your instrument’s true character. You get speedy tracking, crystal-clear response, and zero compromise in tone—whether shifting down, simulating a capo, or using extreme octave jumps for effect. The versatile XS-1 unlocks a new level of performance freedom, making tuning changes fast, fluid, and seamless.\n\nIn developing the XS series, BOSS engineers pioneered new methods to advance real-time pitch shifting and eliminate the tonal artifacts common in conventional designs. Powered by finely tuned algorithms and a specially selected DSP platform, the XS-1 provides balanced polyphonic performance that feels natural and musical across all playing styles, pickup positions, and pedal setups. Your instrument’s attack and tonal character are fully preserved, and even complex chords and sustained lead tones—typically a challenge for pitch shifters—are reproduced with stunning clarity.\n\nRetuning during a performance means long pauses, instrument swaps, or pedal solutions that can color the sound in undesirable ways. With the XS-1, you can shift tunings on demand and retain great sound, feel, and response—without ever breaking the momentum of a show. Authentically play songs in drop tunings, change keys to suit a vocalist’s range, create unique extended-range sounds, and more.\n\nOffering a range of +/- seven semitones and three octaves up or down, the XS-1 adapts to virtually any musical need. Thanks to the signature BOSS compact interface, dialing in sounds is fast and intuitive. With semitone tunings, you’ll usually want to set the Balance knob for effect only to avoid pitch conflicts. For octave shifts, use it to blend in the direct sound for 12-string effects, parallel guitar/bass sounds, and unexplored colors. There’s also a Detune mode to create evocative doubling effects with high-definition tone.\n\nThe XS-1 provides a variety of control options to meet your creative intent. With the flip of a panel control, you can assign the pedal switch for standard on/off toggle use or momentary operation. Connect up to two external footswitches for fast access to alternate tuning modes with your preferred Balance settings. Or add an expression pedal to transform the XS-1 into a dynamic pitch-bending tool for dramatic, ear-turning shifts.\n\nHow BOSS mastered the three As of pitch shifting—Attack, Authenticity, Accuracy—with the XS-1 and XS-100, setting new industry standards.Read more…\n\nDiscover what pitch shifter pedals do, how they work, and why they’re essential tools for guitarists seeking new tones and creative freedom.Read more…\n\nExplore decades of industry-leading BOSS pitch pedal innovation, from the classic OC-2 Octave to the advanced XS-1 and XS-100 Poly Shifters.Read more…\n\nWatch inspiring demo videos and discover new techniques on how to transform your music-making with the BOSS OC-5, PS-6, XS-1, and XS-100.Read more…\n\nA clear guide to the complete BOSS pitch range—learn how the XS-1, XS-100, OC-5, and PS-6 can reshape your sound and inspire new ideas.Read more…\n\nThe London-based guitarist walks us through his history, the power of the XS-100 Poly Shifter, and how he'd explain his style to his granny.Read more…\n\nStraight to right-angle 1/4-inch connectors, 10 ft./3 m length.

      "description": "A Bold New Voice for Sound Innovators\n\nEvery guitarist is on a highly personal tone journey, continually honing their skills and searching for the perfect gear combination to unleash their full potential. The EURUS concept presents a bold new creative path for adventurous sonic explorers, expanding the traditional guitar experience with powerful and expressive BOSS technologies. Born from this breakthrough approach, the EURUS GS-1 infuses a premium instrument with advanced guitar synthesis techniques refined over more than four decades. Deep, inspiring, and infinitely playable, the EURUS GS-1 will take your musical vision where it’s never gone before.\n\nDownload “GS-1 Editor” for iOS\nDownload “GS-1 Editor” for Android\n\nThe EURUS GS-1 fully leverages BOSS’s vast expertise in guitar technology to bring endless creative possibilities to your music. This inspiring instrument has all the sound, feel, and detail you’d expect from a pro-quality guitar, coupled with a polyphonic BOSS synth engine that offers a stunning range of analog-flavored sounds to launch your musical expression into a new dimension. And with onboard Bluetooth®, you can customize synth sounds and control multiple performance parameters with the convenience of wireless connectivity.\n\nThe synth engine in the EURUS GS-1 delivers exceptional sonic quality and natural touch response realized through 40-plus years of BOSS guitar synthesizer development. The six onboard memories come filled with ready-to-play sounds, and you have access to many, many more with the GS-1 Editor. There’s also a synth control knob that enables a wide range of dynamic expression as you play. Every synth sound offers smooth playability that fully responds to all your guitar techniques, with no latency or triggering issues to disturb your musical flow.\n\nThe GS-1 Editor app for iOS and Android mobile devices unlocks deep programming power for the guitar’s synth engine. Many different synth types and variations are available for crafting sounds, along with tone, resonance, and other adjustable parameters. You can also assign a range of target parameters to the guitar’s synth control knob and save favorite sound combinations on your device for quick loading before performances.\n\nThe optional EV-1-WL Wireless MIDI Expression Pedal brings cable-free external control to the EURUS GS-1 via Bluetooth®. Using the GS-1 Editor, you can assign parameters such as pitch bend, hold, filter depth, and more to the EV-1-WL’s pedal, toe switch, and up to two external footswitches. Each sound can contain its own set of assignments, allowing you to perform octave bends on a synth lead, slow filter sweeps on a pad sound, and nearly anything else you can dream up.\n\nCrafted in Japan with pro-quality details and components, the EURUS GS-1 is truly a pleasure to play. The modern offset body design is stylish and well-balanced, and the slim-profile neck features a compound radius fretboard for playing comfort and 24 frets for extended range. High-performance Gotoh hardware delivers smooth tremolo action and solid tuning stability with a two-point fulcrum bridge and staggered-height locking machine heads. Custom designed for the EURUS GS-1, the two humbucking pickups provide wide-range tone plus split-coil voicing at two stops of the five-way switch.\n\nThe guitar and synth electronics are fully independent in the EURUS GS-1, allowing you to switch between the two voices seamlessly. Use it as a regular guitar, then instantly transition to the selected synth sound with the flip of a switch.

      "description": "Industry-Leading Tone with Breakthrough BOSS Technology\n\nDelivering unmatched sound quality and musical expression, the GT-1000 ushers in a new era of performance in amp/effects processors for guitar and bass. This premium tone machine features our groundbreaking AIRD (Augmented Impulse Response Dynamics) technology, realized with decades of BOSS research and class-leading 32-bit/96 kHz processing. There’s also a huge range of BOSS effects, complete with ultra-flexible routing options and deep real-time control. And with built-in Bluetooth®, you can tweak settings wirelessly from your mobile device via the dedicated BTS app. Packing immense power in a streamlined pro design, the GT-1000 is a game changer that brings new levels of creative expression to players everywhere.\n\nFor optimal performance, stay up to date with the current GT-1000 system software and BOSS Tone Studio.\n\nDownload “BTS for GT-1000” for iOS\nDownload “BTS for GT-1000” for Android\nDownload “BOSS TONE STUDIO for GT-1000” for Windows/macOS\n\nThe GT-1000 brings you no-compromise audio performance backed by the latest BOSS technologies. It’s the first-ever guitar multi-effects unit with 32-bit AD/DA, 32-bit floating-point processing, and 96 kHz sampling rate throughout, while the custom DSP engine packs over three times the power of previous generations. This immense processing muscle unlocks far greater sonic detail than ever before possible, making it easy to get the sounds you’re after without endless parameter tweaks and microscopic EQ adjustments.\n\nThe GT-1000 harnesses BOSS’s breakthrough AIRD technology for a new level of performance, flexibility, and usability, offering consistent and reliable response in every playing scenario. Your sounds flow smoothly into any creative setup, providing great tone and natural tube amp feel with minimal adjustments. A large selection of AIRD Output Select types tailor the sound for any destination, whether it’s a guitar amp input, a power amp driving guitar speakers, or a full-range monitoring system—or all of them at once. AIRD is fully integrated into the GT-1000 amps at every level, so you’ll always experience their authentic sound and response, no matter what you’re plugged into.\n\nThe GT-1000 features a wide range of BOSS original amplifiers suitable for all guitar styles, from super-clean to ultra-heavy. Several amp types employ MDP (Multi-Dimensional Processing) technology for dynamic, nuanced tone that reaches beyond the capabilities of analog designs. Classic tube amps throughout history are also included, from coveted vintage combos to modern high-gain heads. Two amps can be used at once in a single patch, allowing you to switch between two sounds, blend amps for complex tones, or achieve big, expansive sound in stereo setups.\n\nThe GT-1000 comes loaded with all types of effects, from BOSS classics and retro stompboxes to modern effects driven by MDP and other advanced technologies. Multiple series and parallel routings are easy to set up via the intuitive interface. And with the clever Stompbox feature, you can adjust commonly used amp and effects settings across multiple patches at once. There are also two effects loops for patching in your favorite external effects and preamps.\n\nThe GT-1000 takes bass processing to new heights with next-generation sound quality and ultra-flexible performance features. A variety of AIRD bass preamps are on hand for shaping your core tone, while eight different overdrive/distortion effects are available for additional color and gain. There’s an MDP bass compressor as well, plus chorus, flanger, touch wah, and many other effect types specially tuned for bass.\n\nWith its ten footswitches and expression pedal with toe switch, the GT-1000 provides comprehensive creative control wherever you play. And you can go even deeper with external switches, pedals, MIDI, and USB. The onboard controls come with default assignments for preset selection and per-patch control targets, but you can easily reassign them to operate nearly any function. Manual and Pedalboard modes are also available to instantly reconfigure the footswitches for additional control in the heat of the moment.\n\nThe GT-1000 features a multi-channel USB audio/MIDI interface for flexible computer recording and efficient re-amping. Edit sounds remotely with the BOSS Tone Studio app, either via USB on a computer or wirelessly from your mobile device. And use the dedicated IR loader software to expand your tone options with 16 of your favorite speaker cab IRs.\n\nThe Version 4.0 update brings even more creative features to the GT-1000 platform, including three newly developed high-gain guitar amp types that spotlight the continuing evolution of our advanced AIRD and MDP technologies:\n\nX-Ultra—Inspired by a classic British stack amp modified with a modern multi-stage gain circuit. MDP provides intelligent control of the clipping in each gain stage, realizing extended dynamic response that’s not possible with traditional analog designs.\n\nX-Optima—With many high-gain tube amplifiers, it can be difficult to strike the ideal tonal balance between chords and single notes. X-Optima features an innovative new gain algorithm that takes full advantage of MDP’s adaptive frequency shaping, providing well-defined rhythm sounds and rich lead tones that sit perfectly in every mix.\n\nX-Titan—This articulate amp type is perfect for aggressive metal styles driven by heavy riffs. MDP delivers sharp, tight sounds on the low strings while retaining fatness and body in the high ranges, making it well-suited for down tunings and extended-range guitars with seven or eight strings.\n\nThe update also includes six new bass preamps, two new drive effects, and more.\n\nLearn more about the GT-1000 Version 4.0 update.\n\nWill Sergeant talks Echo & the Bunnymen’s iconic guitar tones, Roland and BOSS gear, and how he’s shaped the post-punk sound since 1978.Read more…\n\nFrom dub to punk to electronic, Gorillaz’s touring bass player relies on the BOSS GT-1000 Guitar Effects Processor for his seismic low end.Read more…\n\nBOSS multi-effects combine a full arsenal of tones, effects, and amp models into a single, streamlined unit, offering a flexible alternative to traditional pedalboard setups.Read more…\n\nExplore key features, functionality, and learning resources to get the most out of the GT series.Read more…\n\nLearn how the BOSS V-Guitar System can streamline your setup and expand your creative possibilities onstage with powerful processing.Read more…\n\nThe shred virtuoso talks about the power of songwriting, her social media success, and stamping out separation, misogyny, and sexism.Read more…\n\nThe popularity of guitar impulse response (IR) and cabinet simulator pedals has led to exciting tonal options for guitarists.Read more…\n\nGiving you a head start on using the GT-1000 to unlock your full creativity.Read more…\n\nJanek Gwizdala kindly introduces the new GT-1000 for bass and summarizes the newly added features.\n\nSam Bell introduces the newly added features with the BOSS GT-1000 Version 3 update.\n\nPlease check 15 newly added presets on GT-1000 version 3 specially tuned for bass.

      "description": "A Modern Boutique Experience for Serious Players\n\nFueled by BOSS’s acclaimed Tube Logic approach, the Nextone Special delivers premium sound, feel, and tonal versatility for stage players who demand the best. Fusing forward-thinking innovation with boutique design features and detail, this professional stage amplifier offers deep sound-shaping controls, enhanced reactive drive power amp circuitry with selectable voicing, a custom Waza speaker with vintage “blue bell” tone, and much more. The Nextone Special provides a refined playing experience that stands alongside the finest tube amplifiers, enhanced with key modern advantages like variable power control, consistent sound, and maintenance-free operation.\n\nDownload “NEXTONE SPECIAL EDITOR” for Windows/macOS\n\nFueled by BOSS’s acclaimed Tube Logic approach, the Nextone Special delivers premium sound, feel, and tonal versatility for stage players who demand the best. Fusing forward-thinking innovation with boutique design features and detail, this professional stage amplifier offers deep sound-shaping controls, enhanced reactive drive power amp circuitry with selectable voicing, a custom Waza speaker with vintage “blue bell” tone, and much more. The Nextone Special provides a refined playing experience that stands alongside the finest tube amplifiers, enhanced with key modern advantages like variable power control, consistent sound, and maintenance-free operation.\n\nThe Nextone Special represents the latest generation of BOSS’s ongoing Tube Logic development, giving experienced players a premium-grade amplifier realized through years of expertise, careful component selection, and detailed craftsmanship. Tube Logic reproduces the complex interactive behaviors of classic tube designs in every way, providing authentic sound and feel with punchy attack, natural compression, dynamic speaker response, and big onstage presence. The amp also debuts BOSS’s custom Waza B12W speaker, which combines the tone of sought-after “blue bell” speakers from the 1960s with modern power handling capacity.\n\nA standout of the Nextone series is its innovative analog power amp design and selectable EL84, EL34, 6V6, and 6L6 class AB circuits. BOSS further expands the power amp features with the Nextone Special, taking things to an all-new level. Enhanced reactive drive circuitry refines the all-important power section/speaker interaction, putting even more expressive feel under your fingers. Onboard voicing controls let you fine-tune the response to your playing style, with even deeper tweaks available via the Nextone Editor. And with the variable power control, you can always ride in the “sweet spot,” whether performing in small venues or on the biggest stages.\n\nWith two independent, fully featured channels, the Nextone Special gives you unprecedented control over your personal sound. Choose between clean and lead voicings, select British or American tone stacks, access multiple onboard effects, and shape the power section with dedicated knobs. There’s an Extra Headroom switch for maximum punch at full power, plus the ability to set switchable solo levels for clean and lead sounds. Three Tone Setting memories are also available, letting you save favorite setups for instant recall.\n\nWhile everyone loves the sound and vibe of classic tube guitar amps, they’re heavy, fragile, and require regular maintenance to keep them running at peak performance. With the Nextone Special, you get all the benefits of authentic tube tone without the downsides. The weight is reduced over a typical tube combo, making transport and set up easier. And with no tubes to worry about, you’ll enjoy consistent sound and ultra-reliable performance night after night.\n\nThe Nextone Special’s rear panel is filled with connectivity for modern performance and music production. External control is supported via the GA-FC foot controller, standard BOSS footswitches, and MIDI. There’s also an effects loop, plus XLR and 1/4-inch line outputs for sending a direct feed to a PA, complete with three selectable mic’d cab IR voicings with Air Feel. A phones/recording output is available for silent practice and tracking sessions, along with USB for direct recording and communication with the Nextone Editor software.

      "description": "Your Ultimate Guitar Companion\n\nThe GX-1 delivers professional-grade sound and features in an ultra-portable platform for practice, recording, and performance. Authentic GX series amp and effect algorithms supply endless creative fuel, while the high-res color display, intuitive effect buttons, and Gear Suite tools make sound creation a snap. Rugged, powerful, and remarkably compact, the GX-1 is filled with inspiring tones for every guitarist, from beginning players to touring pros seeking an all-in-one travel solution with no-compromise sound.\n\n*Compatibility with all third-party devices and software is not guaranteed.\n\nDownload “BTS for GX-1” for iOS\nDownload “BTS for GX-1” for Android\nDownload “BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-1” for Windows/macOS\n\nPowered by algorithms inherited from the GX-100, the GX-1 makes great tone accessible to every player, regardless of skill level. Explore 23 highly expressive AIRD amps, complemented by over 140 effects from the vast BOSS library. With adjustable effect order and eight simultaneous blocks plus a volume pedal and noise suppressor, you can easily craft custom setups for playing different music styles and performing specific songs on stage.\n\nWhether editing presets or building sounds from scratch, the GX-1 is designed for frustration-free creation. Inspired by the GX-100 and GX-10 interfaces, the hexagon-shaped effect buttons provide a visual representation of the sound categories, and you can use them to turn effects on/off with a tap or access detailed parameters with a long press. You also get 99 memories loaded with ready-to-play presets, plus 99 user memories for storing your custom sound creations.\n\nThe GX-1 introduces Gear Suite, a powerful new feature for dialing in amp and effect sounds fast. Each amp/effect type contains multiple factory Gear Suite settings, letting you recall a complete set of professionally tuned parameters with the turn of a knob. You can also edit effect parameters to taste and save favorites in user Gear Suite locations for instant access to personalized settings.\n\nOnce you’ve crafted your tones, grow your expressive range on stage with advanced real-time control. Assign the onboard footswitches and expression pedal to control anything you can imagine—from basic effects on/off to adjusting one or more parameter targets at once—and go even further with wired and wireless options for external control. The GX-1 also offers three versatile power options (batteries, AC adaptor, or USB), allowing you to practice and perform anywhere.\n\nThe GX-1 flows wherever your creativity takes you. Interface with a mobile device or computer via Bluetooth or USB to jam with songs and record tracks in a DAW. When you’re ready to dive deeper, BOSS Tone Studio is your ideal partner.

      "description": "Colorful Tones, Portable Design\n\nPlayers everywhere love the GX-100 for its streamlined design, free-flowing interface, and high-quality tones. Armed with the core GX-100 engine, the compact GX-10 brings you the same inspiring experience in an even more portable footprint. You get loads of AIRD amps and effects for covering every style, plus speedy sound building with the intuitive color touch display and panel knobs. Adding in multi-mode footswitches, an integrated expression pedal, and USB audio connectivity, the GX-10 seamlessly transitions from nightly stage performing to desktop recording, song creation, and daily practice sessions.\n\n*Compatibility with all third-party devices and software is not guaranteed.\n\nDownload “BTS for GX-10” for iOS\nDownload “BTS for GX-10” for Android\nDownload “BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-10” for Windows/macOS\n\nThe GX-10 brings you a universe of ultra-responsive BOSS tone processing in a travel-ready size. Take on every playing situation with 23 guitar amps and nine bass amps, including high-gain X-Ultra, X-Optima, and X-Titan types crafted with our latest technologies. And let your imagination run wild with 170 effects, including overdrives and distortions, mod effects, delays, and reverbs, plus dedicated bass effects and BOSS classics like Slow Gear, Octave, Slicer, and more.\n\nThe GX-10 enables fast sound creation with its inviting color touch display and four dynamic parameter knobs. Assign up to two amps and 15 effects in each memory. Create serial or parallel effect routings and change the order by dragging blocks with a finger on the screen. And patch in your go-to external pedals with the send/return loop. BOSS Tone Studio takes things even further, allowing you to edit sounds and load IRs from your computer or wirelessly tweak tones via our optional Bluetooth adaptor and the mobile version of the app.\n\nPacking clever control options into a minimal layout, the GX-10 gives you powerful tools for real-time sound adjustment while performing. Versatile control modes provide maximum flexibility with just three footswitches. The expression pedal toggles between volume and wah and activates the tuner when you pull the pedal back. But you can customize it to control nearly anything you want with the GX-10’s assign matrix.\n\nUp/Down Mode—Simplify your rig by scrolling through memories one at a time. Set up basic memories for clean, crunch rhythm, and lead sounds. Or load up the 66 banks and 198 user memories with custom sounds for your set list and tap through them sequentially on stage.\n\nManual Mode—This reconfigures the footswitches to control three user-assignable targets. Use them like a pedalboard to turn effects on/off or kick in a solo boost. Or go deeper by changing up to 20 assignable parameters with just one press.\n\nBank/Number Mode—This mode allows you to select memories within banks. It also unlocks the Current Number function, providing access to one or more parameters by pressing the switch for the currently loaded memory. Using this function, you can extend your tonal options for each memory with a solo boost, delay effect, or anything else you’d like to assign.\n\nIn addition to editing, BOSS Tone Studio allows you to organize GX-10 sounds into Livesets for different gigs and playing situations. You can also access BOSS Tone Exchange within the app to download professionally created sounds and share GX-10 Livesets with the global BOSS community. GX-100 Livesets are fully compatible with the GX-10 as well. In addition, there’s a built-in USB-C audio interface for capturing high-quality guitar tones in music production apps on computers and mobile devices.\n\nBOSS multi-effects combine a full arsenal of tones, effects, and amp models into a single, streamlined unit, offering a flexible alternative to traditional pedalboard setups.Read more…\n\nAn exciting world of effects awaits keyboardists from rotary, chorus, flanging, and phasing to reverb, delay, distortion, loopers, and more.Read more…\n\nGX is the latest addition to the comprehensive BOSS range of multi-effects processors, offering extreme flexibility with intuitive control.Read more…\n\nHigh-quality footswitch cap for select BOSS products.\n\nCarrying case for the BOSS GX-10, GT-1, and GT-1B.\n\nDurable metal footswitch available in latching and unlatching types.\n*Some products are compatible with either FS-5U or FS-5L only. Please check the specs to confirm the suitable model.\n\nTwo switches in one, BOSS’s FS-6 combines latch- and momentary-type switching into one unit.\n\nCompact, multifunctional dual footswitch for remote control of effect pedals or amp channel switching.\n\nSmooth and precise expression control in a pedalboard-friendly size.\n\nTank-tough diecast volume pedals with high/low impedance option.\n\nDurable expression pedal for use with keyboards or other Expression-compatible instruments to control a range of functions and effects parameters.\n\nCompact adaptor that brings Bluetooth wireless capabilities to compatible BOSS and Roland products.\n\nPowerful MIDI expression pedal for controlling devices through Bluetooth MIDI, USB, and TRS MIDI outputs.\n\nCustomizable Bluetooth foot controller for software applications and MIDI hardware.\n\nStraight to right-angle 1/4-inch connectors, 10 ft./3 m length. Available in black (BIC-10A-BK), orange (BIC-10A-OR), yellow (BIC-10A-YL), green (BIC-10A-GN), red (BIC-10A-RD), and blue (BIC-10A-BU).\n\nIf you have questions about operating your BOSS product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support department by phone or email.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "Timeless Effects, Infinite Inspiration\n\nThe PX-1 Plugout FX is an innovative hardware platform that captures the timeless BOSS compact pedal experience in one versatile pedal. This convertible stomp holds multiple authentic effect recreations from the historic BOSS lineup, providing endless fuel for every creative journey. With the PX-1 in your setup, exploring the vast and influential world of BOSS compact pedals has never been easier.\n\nFor optimal performance, stay up to date with the current PX-1 system software.\n\nDownload “BOSS Effect Loader” for iOS\nDownload “BOSS Effect Loader” for Android\n\nSince 1977, BOSS compact pedals have inspired generations of musicians around the world. Over 140 unique models have been produced, over 19 million units have been sold, and many have remained in non-stop production for decades. From vintage classics and go-to workhorses to rare and specialty effects, the PX-1 puts the diverse BOSS compact pedal range at your command.\n\nBacked by newly developed BOSS algorithms, each effect in the PX-1 delivers the authentic sound and response of the pedal it’s based on. Every detail is modeled with stunning accuracy, thanks to a powerful DSP engine dedicated to recreating the sound of a single effect at a time. Dial in tones fast with the familiar knob interface you’re used to with BOSS compacts, supported by an onboard display for current parameters and internal settings.\n\nThe PX-1 supports external control with one or two footswitches or an expression pedal. Use the Swap function to switch between two effects. Or assign nearly any parameter for real-time expressive control while performing. Stereo I/O provides flexible connectivity and enhanced sound for models that support stereo operation, while tap tempo and MIDI clock sync help you get the most out of time-based effects.\n\nThe PX-1’s permanent library features eight famous BOSS pedals, including the three models from the 1977 debut and iconic drive pedals like the DS-1 and SD-1. Every model has a “1” designation, indicating that it’s the first of its type within the BOSS timeline.\n\nThe OD-1 invented the now ubiquitous “overdrive” category in stompbox effects. Designed with an asymmetrical clipping circuit that reproduces the pleasing sound of a driven tube amp, this yellow classic dishes up warm, fat tones rich with even-order harmonics.\n\nThis unique and rare BOSS effect boosts a single frequency band determined by the Spectrum control. It’s great for many tone-shaping applications, such as adding presence to solo lines, boosting the character of overdrive and distortion pedals, and creating nasal “cocked wah” lead tones.\n\nThe PH-1 produces a mild phaser sound with a full low-end response. Skillful engineering allows you to dial in a range of musical tones with a simple two-knob interface.\n\nThis well-loved BOSS original reshapes the note attack to create violin-like swell tones. The SG-1 is particularly effective when crafting ambient sounds with delays and reverbs.\n\nThe first BOSS compressor pedal has a distinctly different circuit than the later CS-2 and CS-3 models. It features an optical design with a photocoupler, which offers a slower attack with a unique character.\n\nThe TW-1 provides a classic wah effect that’s controlled by the input signal level. Two controls adjust the sensitivity and depth of the input filter.\n\nThe workhorse SD-1 has been the core gain pedal for generations of players across every musical genre. Expanding on the OD-1 design with enhanced voicing and a tone control, this essential stomp is packed with highly musical overdrive colors.\n\nThe DS-1 is the top-selling BOSS compact pedal ever. Its original, unchanged design delivers a hard-edged attack and smooth sustain, making it a player’s staple for nearly four decades.\n\nThe following eight effects are also included with the PX-1, and you can load them into the pedal’s eight user locations. After registering your pedal with a free Roland Account, download the effects into the PX-1 using the BOSS Effect Loader app.\n\nThe CE-2 distilled the sound of the CE-1 Chorus Ensemble—the first BOSS pedal and the world’s first chorus effect—into the smaller compact pedal format. Tuned for mono operation and a lighter modulation sound than the CE-1, this signature BOSS original has defined the guitar tones on countless hits from the 1980s to the present day.\n\nIn production for over 20 years, the original BF-2 hardware featured a unique analog design based around a single BBD chip. This versatile effect produces an array of warm modulated tones, from metallic and phase-shifted textures to soft chorus and wavering vibrato.\n\nThe PN-2 combines tremolo and panning effects in one design. Tremolo mode produces a tighter amplitude modulation effect than traditional circuits, while Pan mode moves the audio signal across the stereo field. Triangle and square wave shapes are available for different sound characteristics.\n\nThe original OC-2 hardware was a pioneer in octave pedals, producing touch-responsive tones with an all-analog circuit and a unique method of phase inversion. The OC-2 works great for adding mono octave sounds to any instrument, and it’s legendary among bassists for its ability to create synth-like sub-bass tones.\n\nThe PS-2 brought continuous pitch shifting to the compact pedal format in 1987, and the effect remains popular for its retro 8-bit processing and vintage digital character. Three pitch modes include a manual option for fine-tuning the pitch over two octaves and presets for one octave up and one octave down. The PS-2 also includes three delay modes with time ranges from 30 ms to two full seconds.\n\nThis underground BOSS classic produces warm, characterful tones with mild pitch fluctuations and dynamic control of the modulation onset with the Rise Time function. In addition to standard toggle operation for the pedal switch, a special Unlatch mode adds the effect only when holding the switch.\n\nReleased in 1983, the DD-2 hardware was the world’s first digital delay in stompbox form. Created in the early days of digital music technology, the DD-2 is still loved for its warm 12-bit tones that sit perfectly in the mix.\n\nCompared with the DS-1 Distortion, the DF-2 offers higher gain and a smoother attack character. Its secret weapon is the feedbacker function, which lets you enjoy the sustained harmonic feedback of a cranked amp at any volume, including practice sessions with headphones. Hold the pedal switch or an external footswitch to punctuate performances with this expressive tone as you play.\n\nMany more PX-1 effects will be added over time, and each new effect will be available with a low-cost Model Pass within the BOSS Effect Loader app.\n\nThe same PX-1 effects are also available for computer music production with the BOSS Effects Pedals plug-in on Roland Cloud, and six months of Roland Cloud Ultimate membership comes with the pedal. This gives you complete access to the full BOSS Effects Pedals library, JC-120 Jazz Chorus and RE-201 Space Echo plug-ins, and many other powerful creative tools.\n\nLearn More About Roland Cloud\nLearn More About the BOSS Effects Pedals Plug-In\n\n*Pricing varies per region.\n\nExplore the world of classic BOSS pedals—now reborn as DAW-ready plug-ins—and find out how you can bring timeless tone to your tracks.Read more…\n\nThe PX-1 Plugout FX is an innovative hardware platform that captures the timeless BOSS compact pedal experience in one versatile pedal.\n\nChris Booth kindly introduces the tones of 16 starter models.\n\nCompact, multifunctional dual footswitch for remote control of effect pedals or amp channel switching.\n\nTwo switches in one, BOSS’s FS-6 combines latch- and momentary-type switching into one unit.\n\nDurable metal footswitch available in latching and unlatching types.\n*Some products are compatible with either FS-5U or FS-5L only.
