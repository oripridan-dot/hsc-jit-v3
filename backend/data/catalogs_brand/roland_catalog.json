      "description": "The A-49’s keys have a rounded shape for better reaction to the player’s touch and more comfortable glissandi. Other enhancements have been made to reduce the already low mechanical noise and eliminate vertical shake. All of these features add up to a keyboard that even the most discerning pros will appreciate. Add color to your sound and excitement to your performance by waving your hands over the invisible D-BEAM. The A-49 can assign all its controllers automatically for fully utilizing an external SuperNATURAL sound module such as the INTEGRA-7. It’s also a great second keyboard for controlling synthesizers that have onboard SuperNATURAL sounds, such as the JUPITER-80 and JUPITER-50.\n\nThe A-49 was born for mobile use. It’s strong yet amazingly lightweight (less than six pounds/2.5 kilograms), making it easy to lift and carry. And although it has a very streamlined design, the A-49 features a full-size, premium keyboard with 49 velocity-sensitive keys. For the ultimate in portable convenience, the A-49 is powered from your computer’s USB bus — no power cable or adapter is required. It draws a minimal amount of current, which is ideal for a USB bus-powered device.\n\nThe A-49 provides clean connections via its recessed rear panel, so you can place a computer monitor or laptop in the perfect position for creating music. Two knobs, two switches, and the D-BEAM controller are all easily accessible and intelligently arranged to make your workflow fast and fluid. Dedicated octave buttons offer immediate control of the key scale, and a transpose button is provided for adjusting the scale in semitone steps; LED indicators give you instant visual feedback of your octave/transpose settings. Other settings can be accessed via the Function button, which lets you use the keys to perform additional tasks printed above the keyboard.\n\nRecently, many musicians have gravitated toward their Apple iPads to record musical ideas. While there are small MIDI keyboards that can be used with the iPad, the A-49 gives you pro playability as well as mobility. Its clean, clutter-free surface and excellent feel keeps your fingers on the keys and your mind on the music.\n\n*The A-49 can be connected to the iPad via Apple’s iPad Camera Connection Kit.\n\nMIDI cable, 3 ft./1 m length. Also available in 5 ft./1.5 m (RMIDI-B5), 10 ft./3 m (RMIDI-B10), 15 ft./4.5 m (RMIDI-B15), and 20 ft./6 m (RMIDI-B20) lengths.\n\n49-Note Keyboard Bag with Shoulder Straps.\n\nThis well-built, real-feel pedal comes with a non-slip rubber plate — essential when performing on hardwood or slip-prone surfaces — and an extended cable (2.2m) for stacked multi-keyboard setups.\n\nMomentary footswitch for use with keyboards and recording products.\n\nDurable expression pedal for use with keyboards or other Expression-compatible instruments to control a range of functions and effects parameters.\n\nFlexible solutions for your music production needs.\n\nThis is the latest version of operating system for the A-49. After downloading and extracting the compressed file, please refer to the “A-49_System_Update_Procedure” pdf document included for the update procedure.\n\nThis is the A-Series Keyboard driver for Microsoft Windows 8 / 7 / Vista / XP. (* There is a newer driver for Windows 8.)\n\nThis is a driver for using the A-Series Keyboard on Mac OS X v10.5 / v10.6 / v10.7 / OS X v10.8.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "The latest in our long line of professional MIDI controllers, the Roland A-88MKII is supremely playable, with onboard creative tools for today's musicians and producers. Our acclaimed hammer-action keyboard and built-to-last quality combine with modern features like USB-C connectivity, RGB-lit controls, and MIDI 2.0 support for the best performance in its class.\n\nWhen it comes to MIDI controllers, playability often seems like an afterthought. With the A-88MKII, we bring our acclaimed keyboard feel, enjoyed by professional players on stages around the world, to your studio. Its robust wood construction creates a solid playing experience you can feel under your fingers. And you can easily adjust the sensitivity and responsiveness to match your unique playing style.\n\nThe A-88MKII has three user-definable zones, so you can layer and split the keyboard with different sounds or instruments. Our unique pitch/mod lever and an array of RGB-lit knobs and pads give you expressive, hands-on control of your sound. And a sustain pedal input plus two fully assignable pedal inputs mean your feet can get in on the action too.\n\nToday's musical styles demand special production techniques. And some soft synths and modules don't always have the onboard tools you might like. The A-88MKII extends your creative arsenal with three configurable zones, advanced arpeggiator, chord memory, and multipurpose pads that can trigger commands and events, and energize real-time performance.\n\nThe A-88MKII includes the latest technologies for years of universal compatibility and convenience. Class-compliant USB-C enables bus power and single-cable connectivity with devices running Windows, macOS, iOS, and iPadOS.* The latest A-88MKII system software (Version 2.0 and later) provides support for MIDI 2.0, unlocking advanced real-time expressive capabilities with the keyboard and panel knobs.\n\n*An appropriate Apple USB-C adaptor is required to connect the A-88MKII to an iPhone or iPad equipped with the Lightning interface. Bus power is not supported with this connection, so the A-88MKII must be powered with the optional PSB-1U AC power adaptor.\n\nCustomize the A-88MKII with the control app for macOS and Windows. See all your layers and control mappings at a glance and assign commands to the pads with custom colors for visual feedback. You can create custom setups to control specific soft synths or external hardware and instantly recall everything with the handy Snap Shot function.\n\nSpace is always at a premium in today's personal studios. The A-88MKII is designed to be as thin and shallow as possible while still retaining the smooth, dynamic playability that Roland instruments are known for. Surfaces are flat and edges are squared so they sit neat and flush against other gear or when integrated into a studio desk.\n\nThe prolific player shares her thoughts on touring with RAYE, finding success in the music industry, and her Roland gear.Read more…\n\nVersatile table-style stand for keyboard instruments.\n\nHeavy-duty adjustable Z-stand for stage pianos and other keyboards.\n\nSemi-rigid keyboard case with integrated wheels for 88-note instruments.\n\nVersatile carrying bag for portable 88-note keyboards.\n\nMIDI cable, 3 ft./1 m length. Also available in 5 ft./1.5 m (RMIDI-B5), 10 ft./3 m (RMIDI-B10), 15 ft./4.5 m (RMIDI-B15), and 20 ft./6 m (RMIDI-B20) lengths.\n\nThree grand piano pedals in one convenient, clutter-free unit.\n\nDurable expression pedal for use with keyboards or other Expression-compatible instruments to control a range of functions and effects parameters.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "Aerophone AE-10 is a digital wind instrument that lets you play sax, clarinet, flute, violin, synth sounds and many more. Since it supports traditional sax fingering, the AE-10 is instantly familiar to acoustic sax players, especially with a mouthpiece-mounted breath sensor that responds like an acoustic horn. The AE-10 also features 128* high-quality sound models including soprano and baritone sax, clarinet, trumpet, string instruments, and an array of expressive synth sounds. And the integrated speaker and battery operation means that you can play these sounds anywhere. With built-in speakers, headphones for late-night practice, battery power capability, and DAW connectivity, the Roland Aerophone AE-10 is the versatile, play-anywhere choice that supports you in every musical scenario.\n\n*Version 3.0 software includes 128 tones, with 66 new tones to expand your repertoire\n\nNothing beats the sound of your favorite acoustic sax, but sometimes its tone might not be quite right for the job at hand. Whatever scenario you’re playing in, the Aerophone AE-10 has the onboard digital sax sounds you need. Choose from alto, tenor, soprano, and baritone sax types, all of which respond just like their acoustic counterparts. Playing dynamics, articulation, and even the organic overtone changes caused by your breathing are all reproduced thanks to Roland’s advanced SuperNATURAL modeling technology. A dedicated “Sax Section” layers four types of sax for playing together in unison, and you can pull off a seamless performance with the Full Range feature, which automatically switches between sax types by key range.\n\nThe Aerophone AE-10 also features sounds from other wind instruments including trumpet, trombone, clarinet, flute, oboe, bassoon, and more. Powered by Roland’s SuperNATURAL technology, which faithfully matches the behavior of the originals, these sounds help to expand your musical range. Ethnic instruments like shakuhachi and erhu are on hand too, offering authentic pitch and tonal fluctuations that echo their acoustic counterparts. Aerophone AE-10 even includes stringed instruments such as violin, cello, and contrabass, each one capable of unique musical expressions since you control them by breath and fingering instead of bowing. Once you’ve tried the individual sounds, you can create one-man ensembles by layering multiple wind instrument sounds with the Brass Section setting. The AE-10 is also packed with a selection of the latest synth sounds that are specially tailored for wind instrument performance with fully optimized breath control.\n\nYou’ve worked hard to nail your sax technique, but most digital horns make you master a new fingering system, which can be a major setback. With the Roland Aerophone AE-10, it’s a smooth transition, thanks to a layout that’s similar to your favorite acoustic sax—right down to the left-hand octave key. Plus, the AE-10 has a sensitive mouthpiece-mounted breath sensor that also functions as a bite sensor, allowing expressive techniques like vibrato and pitch. Even beginners will be able to enjoy playing the various onboard sounds straight away.\n\nWherever and whenever you play, the portable and lightweight Roland Aerophone AE-10 is ready. Six AA batteries provide mobile power, and onboard monitor speakers deliver comfortable sound for intimate performing situations. You also have the ability to directly connect to a PA or amp for broader coverage, eliminating the need to use a mic. When you need to cover large instruments like tuba and bassoon, the battery-powered Roland CUBE Street EX is a great companion, giving you big sound in a portable package. Playing sessions are even more fun when you connect to your smartphone via the Aerophone AE-10’s stereo mini jack and jam along with favorite songs. And thanks to the headphones option, you can play around the clock without disturbing family members and neighbors.\n\nPlaying sessions are even more fun when you connect a smartphone or music player to jam along with favorite songs. Your device connects to the stereo mini-jack input on the Aerophone AE-10, and plays through the onboard monitor speakers or connected headphones.\n\nWhile the Roland Aerophone AE-10 is a powerful standalone instrument, it also lets you get creative with external gear. You can connect to your computer via USB to play soft synths and external MIDI sound modules through your DAW, with breath control providing a world of unique expression not possible with keyboard synthesizers.\n\nThe Aerophone Editor is a free iOS app for the Aerophone AE-10 that lets you adjust tones, set various playing parameters, and organize tone lists. You’re able to deeply customize sounds and functions with parameters only available in the app, and easily create tone lists for different performance and practice situations. Via a convenient interface, you have access to four tone layers, various controller assignments, effects settings, and more. The Aerophone Editor is a must-have tool to perfectly tailor your Aerophone AE-10 for your own personal playing style.\n\nLearn More...\n\nThe new Roland Aerophone AE-10 is a trailblazing digital wind instrument that fuses a traditional saxophone fingering system with a library of onboard acoustic and synth sounds, plus a breath sensor that reacts just like your favorite acoustic horn. US-based DJ and multi-instrumentalist Masego explores the expressive capabilities of the AE-10’s alto sax sound.\n\nThere’s nothing worse than a studio session grinding to a halt because you need an instrument that you haven’t brought along. That won’t happen with the Aerophone AE-10, as it features 40 acoustic and synth sounds, all powered by Roland’s SuperNATURAL technology for natural and accurate response.  US-based DJ and multi-instrumentalist Masego explores some of the AE-10’s onboard sounds while accompanied by an original backing track.\n\nRegardless of the sound you use, the Aerophone AE-10 provides an paralleled level of expression suitable for any genre of music.  UK-based saxophone player Alistair Parnell, accompanied by the Equinox Saxophone Ensemble, layers onboard synth lead sounds with external synth sounds in an extract from Nigel Wood's “Partial Eclipse” for solo wind synth and wind ensemble (www.saxtetpublications.com).\n\nWherever and whenever you play, the portable and lightweight Aerophone AE-10 is ready. Onboard monitor speakers deliver comfortable sound for intimate performing situations and six AA batteries provide convenient on-the-go power. The AE-10’s mobility is spotlighted in this open-air performance by the Japan-based trio sax triplets.\n\nWhile the Roland Aerophone AE-10 is a powerful standalone instrument, it also lets you get creative with external gear. You can connect to a computer via USB to play soft synths and external MIDI sound modules through your DAW, with breath control providing a world of unique expression not possible with keyboard synthesizers.

      "description": "Meet Aerophone Brisa, an exciting evolution of the growing Roland Aerophone platform. This elegant instrument combines the design and key layout of a traditional flute with the modern benefits of the Aerophone series, including a diverse selection of onboard sounds and deep customization options. Aerophone Brisa also features a newly developed sound engine tailored for different wind instrument styles, with a special focus on the unique articulations and techniques used by flute players.\n\nDiscover the Roland Aerophone Brisa, a revolutionary digital wind instrument designed with flute players in mind. In this in-depth video, flutist Elena Pinderhughes guides you through everything you need to know about Brisa, from expressive sound demos to intuitive design features that adapt to your unique playing style.\n\nIn this exclusive performance, visionary saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings brings Brisa to life, blending his spiritual jazz roots with futuristic textures and tones. His dynamic improvisation showcases the expressive depth and versatility of Brisa, proving that tradition and innovation can coexist in perfect harmony.\n\nWatch acclaimed flutist and composer Elena Pinderhughes bring the Aerophone Brisa to life in this expressive sound demo performance. From acoustic emulations to bold synth textures, Elena showcases Brisa’s wide sonic palette with artistry and flair.\n\nCreating with Aerophone Brisa is a comfortable and friendly experience for flutists, players of other wind instruments, and beginners alike. The stylish, lightweight design offers a straight structure, responsive flute-style keys, and intuitive controls, making playing effortless and enjoyable.\n\nAerophone Brisa features SuperNATURAL Winds, a new Aerophone sound engine that leverages our latest advancements in natural wind expression. Delivering rich, inspiring tones, it faithfully translates every breath nuance into vibrant sound, mirroring the immediate response and dynamic control of acoustic instruments.\n\nWith 100 onboard tones, Aerophone Brisa is ready to fuel limitless creative journeys. Explore a library of flute family instruments, from concert flutes and piccolos to bass and jazz flutes. Expand your range with winds such as saxophone, clarinet, and trumpet, and go further with orchestral strings and world sounds like pan flute and shakuhachi. You can even perform contemporary music styles with modern synthesizers and drum sounds.\n\nEquipped with our newly developed dual breath sensor system, Aerophone Brisa provides natural wind control that will be familiar to all types of players. In contrast with a traditional flute, sound is produced by blowing directly into the mouthpiece, simplifying the playing experience. By adjusting the head joint, it’s easy to dial in the most comfortable playing angle. You can also execute flute octave switching techniques by directing your breath between the two mouthpiece holes as you play.\n\nAerophone Brisa offers multiple fingering options to meet the needs of a wide range of players. Flute and trumpet modes are available, along with a Brisa mode that’s ideal for saxophone and recorder players and anyone new to wind instruments. There are also special fingering modes for playing the instrument with only the right or left hand.\n\nAerophone Brisa’s versatile digital engine allows you to add harmonies and drones to your playing, enriching solo and ensemble sessions with tonalities that typically require multiple musicians. There’s also a transposition function that lets you play any musical piece with your most comfortable fingering.\n\nThere are numerous ways to control Aerophone Brisa sounds in real time, unlocking all-new performance approaches. Use the thumb and S1/S2 buttons to enhance tones with harmonies and unique expressive colors. And with the instrument’s integrated motion sensor, you can apply vibrato, pitch bend, and other effects with simple body movements.\n\nAerophone Brisa flows everywhere your creative life takes you. With the onboard speaker, headphone jack, and rechargeable battery, you can play anytime and anywhere. The USB-C port provides audio/MIDI communication with music production apps, and the headphone output can also be used to connect with a sound system for live performances. In addition, Bluetooth MIDI is available to send wireless MIDI data to Bluetooth-enabled devices and expand your control options with the BOSS FS-1-WL and EV-1-WL.\n\nThis powerful companion app extends the Aerophone Brisa experience with your smartphone or tablet.

      "description": "Take online gaming sound to the next level with BRIDGE CAST, your all-in-one solution for premium livestream audio. This customizable desktop hub is packed with secret weapons to take out the competition, including dual sound mixes, vocal transformer effects, music playback, sound effects, and support for a broadcast-grade mic and headphones. In the heat of the battle, BRIDGE CAST ensures that your audio is always as epic as your gameplay.\n\nThe companion BRIDGE CAST app takes your experience even further, allowing you to customize BRIDGE CAST audio features and enhance streams with royalty-free background music tracks and sound effects via BGM CAST and Roland Cloud.\n\nLearn how BRIDGE CAST's powerful audio tools will elevate your gaming streams with professional sound quality and easy real-time mixing control.\n\nBRIDGE CAST gives you what you need to deliver outstanding sound in every session, coupled with killer sonic tools to help you stand out from the crowd. Roland has been a leading innovator in electronic music and audio/video gear for over 50 years. With BRIDGE CAST on your desktop, you’ll be driving your sound with the brand trusted by generations of top creators worldwide.\n\nConnect BRIDGE CAST to your gaming computer via USB-C.\n\nPlug in a professional microphone to the XLR input.\n\nHook up your headphones.\n\nCustomize the audio and panel functions with the companion app.\n\nSet up personal and stream mixes with the hands-on controls.\n\nBRIDGE CAST lets you chat and interact using a broadcast-grade dynamic or condenser microphone, the foundation of any professional audio setup. The high-performance XLR mic preamp delivers clear, dynamic sound in the box, with no need for messy external add-ons. You get superior audio monitoring too, with a powerful headphone amplifier and high-sensitivity output for pro-quality phones. The versatile headphones connector also supports a headset mic for a quick, single-cable connection.\n\nWith the dual audio mixer in BRIDGE CAST, you can independently balance the mic level, team chats, gameplay sounds, and background music for you and your viewers. Give yourself a winning advantage with a personal mix that prioritizes what you need to hear while gaming. Then create a separate stream mix that’s perfectly balanced for maximum online engagement.\n\nAlong with a headphones output, BRIDGE CAST has a line output for external gaming speakers. Level knobs for each output let you easily control volumes and smoothly transition between phones and speakers during gameplay. There’s also a dedicated streaming level control to dial in the sound for your online audience.\n\nMorph your voice and become your character with fun processing derived from Roland’s famous VT voice transformer products. Adjust the pitch and formant to change your age or gender. Or go even further and take on the persona of a beast or alien.\n\nBRIDGE CAST also includes EQ, compression, and other pro vocal processing to level up your streams. A low-cut filter softens pesky “P” and “T” plosives, while the de-esser cleans up harsh “S” tones. There’s a noise suppressor to throttle background distractions, plus reverb to launch your voice into another dimension. And with the muscular hardware DSP handling the audio load, all your computer power is dedicated to gaming and streaming.\n\nImmerse yourself in 5.1 or 7.1 virtual surround sound for headphones and stereo speaker systems, powered by advanced Roland technology. Audio is converted from a PC to virtual surround sound via a USB connection, delivering a powerful and engaging sound experience.\n\nSlay your competition by highlighting important game sounds with Game EQ presets. Pinpoint audio frequencies and boost their levels to make it easier to hear critical elements, like enemy footsteps in first-person shooter games. You can even fine-tune while visually monitoring the analyzed waveform in real time. Once you find the ideal settings for different game titles, save them in onboard profiles and call them up with quick button presses while playing.\n\nBuilding your brand is an essential part of creating an online following. Choose your core BRIDGE CAST look with bold Black and Ice White finish options. And take it to another level by customizing the detachable faceplate using our downloadable skin template, which allows you to personalize the panel with your team or gamertag design. It’s also possible to customize the LED colors of the four control knobs for additional flair.\n\nThe ergonomic BRIDGE CAST panel lets you easily control your mix while staying focused on the game. Everything you need is at your fingers, including grab-and-go level knobs and assignable buttons for muting sounds and accessing various functions. The rock-solid design won’t move around on your desktop, and the discrete rear-panel connections keep clutter in check.\n\nThe powerful BRIDGE CAST app works in tandem with the hardware, giving you full access to an array of in-depth features. Dial in mic and audio parameters, configure Game EQ presets, and more. You can also re-assign hardware controls for your needs and save/recall custom BRIDGE CAST configurations for different games and streaming audiences.\n\nUsing the BRIDGE CAST app, effortlessly tailor your sound with intuitive microphone settings for speed and precision. The version 5.00 update allows you to adjust EQ with quick-access controls and use the studio-grade compressor to achieve a clean, professional vocal sound with a single fader. There's also an expander that minimizes unwanted background noise without unnatural artifacts.\n\nWith BGM CAST, adding background music and sonic color to streams has never been easier. Available through the BRIDGE CAST app and Roland Cloud, BGM CAST puts a growing selection of royalty-free background music and sound effects at your fingertips. Choose music by mood and genre or create playlists of your favorites for stress-free music management. You can also assign sound effects to the four hardware buttons for instant triggering.\n\nA free Roland Account provides 36 background music tracks and 16 sound effects to use at no charge. Signing up for Roland Cloud Core membership through the BRIDGE CAST app unlocks thousands of additional music tracks and hundreds of sound effects, with new selections added each month. Membership also includes powerful tools for modern music creators, including the ZENOLOGY synthesizer, Zenbeats production software, Sound Packs, and more.\n\nGet the BRIDGE CAST App\n\nIf you need a unified audio and video solution, be sure to check out BRIDGE CAST X.

      "description": "Level up your gaming and streaming sound with BRIDGE CAST ONE, a compact livestreaming audio mixer with hands-on controls. Gain a competitive advantage with powerful features like dual bus mixes, vocal transformer effects, fast-access presets, and support for a broadcast-grade mic and headphones. For even more control, the companion BRIDGE CAST app offers extended audio tools and royalty-free background music and sound effects through BGM CAST on Roland Cloud.\n\nWatch how the streamlined audio tools in BRIDGE CAST ONE make it easy to upgrade your streams with enhanced sound quality and real-time controls.\n\nWith BRIDGE CAST ONE, your online sound is always on par with your gameplay. Backed by 50 years of Roland AV technology, it gives you all the essentials for mixing streams with professional quality. Sleek, multi-function controls provide instant access to vital functions, supported by a deep selection of extended tools in the BRIDGE CAST app.\n\nA great mic is key if you want to sound like a pro. Chat and broadcast online with crystal-clear audio using a high-quality dynamic or condenser microphone connected to the XLR input. The onboard preamp delivers rich, dynamic sound, eliminating the need for external preamps or costly mic activators. Set up is simple with mic rehearsal mode—just follow the quick-start guide in the app. It’s also possible to connect a headset mic via the mini headphone jack.\n\nThe pro audio tools in BRIDGE CAST ONE mean you’ll always keep your audience engaged and your teammates aligned. Quickly manage game sounds and chat audio with a single multi-function knob. Stream clear sound with EQ, compression, noise suppression, and other tools. Add spaciousness with a high-quality reverb effect.\n\nBalance Mode makes it easier to adjust game and chat volumes. It functions like a fader on an audio mixer, enabling you to control both channels smoothly. You can set volume limits for each channel in the app, ensuring a proper balance even if the default game or chat audio is too loud, so you can focus on the game.\n\nEffortlessly tailor your sound within the BRIDGE CAST app with intuitive microphone settings for speed and precision. With the Version 5.00 update, you can adjust EQ with quick-access controls and use the studio-grade compressor to achieve a clean, professional vocal sound with a single fader. There's also an expander that minimizes unwanted background noise without unnatural artifacts.\n\nEnhance game sounds and dominate your competition with customizable Game EQ presets.

      "description": "DJs don’t just play music—they’re also often the MC, livestream producer, sound tech, and remixer, and sometimes the event organizer too. This hefty workload means they need equipment that supports much more than simply mixing songs together. Say hello to the Roland DJ-707M, an integrated livestreaming sound console, multi-purpose audio interface, loudspeaker management system, and fully fledged performance DJ controller that’s equipped to handle the demanding audio needs of any type of DJ.\n\nThe DJ-707M leverages the DSP of Roland’s digital audio consoles to ensure you deliver the loudest, cleanest sound possible—whether it’s with your own PA system or the one already at the venue. Whatever the gig, your clients will remember great sound thanks to features that handle the unexpected, like laptop crashes, surprise guest performers, videographer feeds, and painful audio challenges such as feedback.\n\nUsing the 10 onboard scenes, you can create ‘go-to’ event settings for audio routing, loudspeaker management and system setups—and recall them instantly. Scenes are a huge timesaver for standard event configurations, letting you switch settings for your different speaker systems and recall custom setups for venues where you play regularly.\n\nMaster, booth, and zone outputs all have independent loudspeaker management settings, including four-band EQ, multiband compression, limiter, and mono mode. It’s like having three speaker management processors built into one unit.\n\nFeedback at a gig is dangerous as it can ruin a special speech or even plague the whole event. Built-in feedback suppression listens out for feedback—and even anticipates it—before adjusting the speaker output automatically.\n\nConnect two computers at once for a backup laptop connection or seamless DJ changeover. The USB B port also works as a standard USB audio interface capable of two-way communication with an iOS device, perfect for streaming to your favorite social media platform or playing a mix from your phone.\nLearn More About Livestreaming\n\nWhen an event includes a guest musician or performer, you can easily plug them into the front-facing dual 1/4-inch jacks or 1/8-inch stereo aux input without disrupting your DJ configuration.\n\nThe fully assignable zone output with dedicated level control is ideal for creating a separate mix for a videographer, sending different music to another area of the venue, or even adding a subwoofer.\n\nThe compact DJ-707M is packed with more specifications than bulkier controllers that don’t fit in tight DJ booths and are hard to transport without an equipment van.\n\nYou can’t work if your DJ controller isn’t working. Which is why the DJ-707M is built for life on the road, with rugged, reinforced metal parts both inside and out.\n\nThe DJ-707M’s size fits perfectly between turntables and DJ media players. And it’s Serato DVS Upgrade Ready, so you can use it as the ultimate mobile DJ mixer with your component setup.\n\nDJs know that really rocking an event means sounding great on the mic. The DJ-707M’s mic section is designed to handle any situation, from straightforward speeches and announcements to pitch-corrected karaoke throwdowns.\n\nWith the DNA of a professional audio console, the DJ-707M features studio-quality microphone preamps with independent gain, low-cut, and noise gate on each channel.\n\nIndividual on/off, level, three-band EQ, and effect controls let you get the exact right sound for each microphone. And with dedicated hardware effects from clean reverbs and delays to key-based auto-pitching and auto-ducking, you have total command over your vocal sounds.\n\nFor flexibility when you need it, the front-facing aux inputs can be used with microphones—just flip the switch to MIC for the correct level and impedance. This gives you a total of four mic inputs, enough for the whole party to sing along!\n\nAfter all the event planning, set up, speeches, and introductions, you still need to rock the spot and get the crowd dancing. The DJ-707M lets you fully express your skills as a DJ, combining deep Serato DJ Pro integration with creative tools that you’ll only find on Roland DJ controllers.\n\nWith full Serato DJ Pro support, you can use hot cues, loops, rolls, pitch play, slicer, and more. Serato DJ Pro also comes with iZotope audio effects to stylize your sound with simple one-knob control.\n\nWork the perfect scratch or smoothest blend using the rugged crossfader with full-range curve settings and software-adjustable crossfader margin.\n\nRoland’s pristine-sounding hardware effects can be assigned individually to the dedicated Filter/FX knob on each channel, and include Filter, Dub Echo, Jet, Noise, Reverb, Delay, Bit Crush, Phaser, Noise 2, and more.\n\nThere’s a Roland TR drum machine tucked away on Deck 3, so you can accent your songs with classic TR-808 and 909 drum loops or even provide a backing beat for instrumentalists. Setting Deck 4 to OSC lets you drop sweepers, synth stabs, and other onboard DJ sound effects to spice up a mix.\n\nThe Roland DJ-707M DJ Controller for Mobile DJs is an integrated live sound console, loudspeaker management system, and fully-fledged performance Serato DJ Pro controller that’s equipped to handle the demanding audio needs of working Mobile DJs.\n\nAs livestreaming has quickly become a way of life for DJ's to maintain their skill and entertain those at home, the Roland DJ-707M unlocks livestreaming with an iOS device using the second USB port.\n\nThe DJ-707M is a controller that doubles as a tool for mixing, streaming, and music performance. Learn to utilize its many advanced features.Read more…\n\nA good DJ set is like a story with ups and downs and twists and turns.

      "description": "Launch your musical journey with the E-X10, an inspiring starter keyboard with quality features derived from professional Roland instruments. Have fun as you learn with expressive acoustic pianos and hundreds of other sounds. Command a full band with auto-accompaniment and connect a mic to sing along. Record keyboard performances to check your progress. And play anywhere with the sleek portable design, onboard stereo speaker system, and support for battery-powered operation.\n\nFor over 50 years, Roland has been a trusted leader in electronic instruments for professional musicians around the world. With its attractive design, expressive sounds, and versatile features inspired by our premium keyboards and synthesizers, the E-X10 brings you a solid foundation for growing creative skills and making music a part of your daily life.\n\nThe E-X10 features acoustic piano sounds with superior sound quality and expression descended from our award-winning home and stage pianos. The 61-note keyboard features piano-style keys with a comfortable, responsive feel, allowing you to establish proper techniques that translate smoothly to other keyboard instruments.\n\nAlong with acoustic pianos, the E-X10 is filled with additional sounds to explore a universe of musical styles. Over 600 selections include everything from electric pianos, organs, and orchestral instruments to synthesizers for modern genres. There’s also a wide array of world music sounds for playing regional styles from around the globe.\n\nWith the E-X10, learning music is always engaging and exciting. Have fun and build confidence by playing along with 140 onboard songs. Or connect your mobile device via the aux input and jam with favorites from your music library. When you’re ready to go solo, the auto-accompaniment feature enables you to command a full band with your left hand as you play along with the right. Over 200 preset styles are available, from rock, pop, and jazz to ballads, modern dance music, and more.\n\nEach onboard song includes three lessons that help you build accuracy, complete with scoring to keep you motivated. There’s also a metronome, a time-honored essential for developing good timing. And with the recording feature, you can capture your playing at any time to evaluate progress and hear where you need to improve.\n\nThe friendly E-X10 interface is easy to operate, with an informative display and dedicated buttons for accessing essential functions. Tone, song, and style categories are listed on the panel, allowing you to quickly find what you're looking for without referring to the manual.\n\nWith its light and portable design (3.9 kg/8.6 lb.), you can pick up the E-X10 and play anywhere. Perform with full, clear sound and rich low-end response with the onboard stereo system. Or plug in headphones and mute the speakers for quiet playing sessions that won’t bother others. You can power the E-X10 with the included adaptor, or pop in six AA batteries for up to three hours of playing time on the go.\n\nThe E-X10 features a microphone input, allowing you or a friend to sing with the music through the keyboard’s sound system. And with the USB jack, you can use the keyboard as a MIDI controller with all types of music composition software and learning apps on your computer.\n\nVersatile carrying bag for portable 61-note keyboards like GO:KEYS 3, GO:KEYS 5, JUNO-D6, and other Roland models.\n\nMomentary footswitch for use with keyboards and recording products.\n\nThis well-built, real-feel pedal comes with a non-slip rubber plate — essential when performing on hardwood or slip-prone surfaces — and an extended cable (2.2m) for stacked multi-keyboard setups.\n\nHeadphones for Everyday Music Making and Audio Playback.\n\nEnjoy All the Dynamics of Your Digital Piano, Day or Night.\n\nPremium Open-Air Headphones with a Wide Range of Applications.\n\nClear, Accurate and Comfortable for Studio-Quality Monitoring.\n\nPremium Closed-Back Studio Headphones for Pro Level Monitoring.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

This provides a solid foundation for beginners to develop their skills, along with the expressive range to make experienced players feel right at home.\n\nGoing beyond acoustic piano, the E-X50 provides a universe of additional sounds to explore. Extend your keyboard range with electric pianos, organs, and other instruments, or rock out with a wide variety of guitars and basses. Create a symphony with orchestral strings, brass, and percussion, or play modern genres with synthesizer sounds derived our historic library. And like all Roland arrangers, the E-X50 also offers a vast selection of high-quality regional sounds from all over the world.\n\nThe E-X50’s sophisticated auto-accompaniment features let you command a full band with your left hand as you play along with the right. Enjoy 300 preset styles, from rock, pop, and jazz to ballads, dance music, and traditional styles from different countries. Beginners will love Auto Bass Chord mode, which allows you to trigger chords and drive arrangements with one or two fingers. Whole mode is well-suited for advanced keyboardists, providing the ability to control arrangements even more deeply with full left-hand chords.\n\nIt’s easy to extend your musical enjoyment by connecting a phone or tablet to the E-X50 via Bluetooth. Play along with songs from your streaming library through the onboard speakers, or learn some new techniques by working through the wealth of instructional videos on the web.\n\nWhen you want to sing, simply plug a microphone into the rear input and vocalize through the E-X50’s speakers, complete with ambience effects for a professional sound. And if you ever need more coverage to entertain larger crowds, use the stereo outputs to hook into a larger audio system. There’s also a USB port for interfacing with your favorite music software, plus a USB memory port for backing up sound setups and E-X50 recordings to a USB flash drive.\n\nIf you’re an advanced player who needs even more control over your arrangements, the E-X50 has you covered. Using our Style Converter software for macOS and Windows, you can organize and load up to 30 custom styles into the E-X50’s memory. It’s also possible to adjust scales, tuning, and other parameters to suit your personal performance needs.\n\nDance styles for the E-X50 and E-X30 Arranger Keyboards.\n\nMore dance styles for the E-X50 and E-X30 Arranger Keyboards.\n\nModern pop styles for the E-X50 and E-X30 Arranger Keyboards.\n\nMore modern pop styles for the E-X50 and E-X30 Arranger Keyboards.\n\nSemi-rigid keyboard case with integrated wheels for 61-note instruments.\n\nMomentary footswitch for use with keyboards and recording products.\n\nThis well-built, real-feel pedal comes with a non-slip rubber plate — essential when performing on hardwood or slip-prone surfaces — and an extended cable (2.2m) for stacked multi-keyboard setups.\n\nHeadphones for Everyday Music Making and Audio Playback.\n\nEnjoy All the Dynamics of Your Digital Piano, Day or Night.\n\nPremium Open-Air Headphones with a Wide Range of Applications.\n\nClear, Accurate and Comfortable for Studio-Quality Monitoring.\n\nPremium Closed-Back Studio Headphones for Pro Level Monitoring.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "Do you have a passion for music? GO:KEYS 3 makes it easy to go from being a fan to an active music creator. This fun modern keyboard unlocks a simple new approach to making music, encouraging you to explore sounds and ideas in the moment—no previous experience required. Just power on, push a few buttons, and let your imagination flow. And as your skills develop, deeper features allow you to travel as far as your ambition takes you.\n\nWith GO:KEYS 3 under your fingers, you have everything you need to turn your musical dreams into reality.\n\nLearning music doesn’t have to be hard. GO:KEYS 3 invites exploration at every turn, urging your inner creative voice to emerge. The friendly, interactive interface stimulates discovery and spontaneous musical moments, even if you’ve never played an instrument before.\n\nAs many top composers will tell you, playing one note with an inspiring sound is often all it takes to spark a complete idea. GO:KEYS 3 includes over 1000 sounds from Roland’s historic library, which has motivated top music artists in every genre for over 50 years. Journey through a universe of possibilities with the expressive 61-note keyboard, from acoustic pianos and orchestral instruments to modern synthesizers, guitars, drums, and beyond.\n\nOnce you find a sound that energizes you, experiment by creating melodies and arpeggios over automatic musical backing. GO:KEYS 3 is filled with ready-made chord progressions in various styles, all with the immersive sound of a finished record. It’s also possible to craft your own chord sequences, and you can easily find the progressions for your favorite songs online or with dedicated apps.\n\nAs a chord progression loops, discover your own performance style by remixing sounds. Change things up with four variations. Drop parts in and out, including the drums, bass, and backing chords. Swap instruments for a different vibe. And create dynamic energy by processing the entire sound with filtering, lo-fi tones, beat slicing, and other ear-catching performance effects.\n\nAfter you’ve mastered chord progressions, go even further by directing a band of virtual musicians. GO:KEYS 3 offers a wide selection of dynamic accompaniments controlled by one or two left-hand fingers. Jam melodies and solos with your right hand as the band backs every move. Then weave in more sophisticated textures with full left-hand chords as your technique grows.\n\nAt any time, you can instantly capture what you’re doing with GO:KEYS 3 and listen back. Analyze and hone your ideas. Show off your progress with family and friends. Or share your skills with the world on social media.\n\nWith its portable, all-in-one design, you can pick up GO:KEYS 3 and enjoy music anywhere in your living space. The built-in stereo sound system delivers rich, satisfying sound, while support for AA battery power makes setup fast and easy. And when you want to play privately, plug in headphones or earbuds to enjoy GO:KEYS 3 without disturbing others.\n\nListening to your favorite music is a great way to inspire the next creative session. Play songs from your music library via Bluetooth or USB memory and jam along. Then, use the center cancel function to remove the vocals and sing them yourself. GO:KEYS 3 also supports Bluetooth MIDI and audio/MIDI over USB, opening the door to further creative possibilities with music apps on a computer or mobile device.\n\nWant more inspiration? On Roland Cloud, there’s an ever-growing selection of premium sounds and exciting new arranger styles to explore. GO:KEYS 3 also supports Roland Cloud Connect, an optional wireless adapter that lets you browse, audition, and download Roland Cloud content from your smartphone.\n\nWhen you’re ready to take the next step in your musical journey, Melodics Essentials for Roland is the perfect partner to extend the GO:KEYS experience.

      "description": "Do you have a passion for music? GO:KEYS 5 makes it easy to go from being a fan to an active music creator. This fun modern keyboard unlocks a simple new approach to making music, encouraging you to explore sounds and ideas in the moment—no previous experience required. Just power on, push a few buttons, and let your imagination flow. And as your skills develop, deeper features allow you to travel as far as your ambition takes you.\n\nWith GO:KEYS 5 under your fingers, you have everything you need to turn your musical dreams into reality.\n\nLearning music doesn’t have to be hard. GO:KEYS 5 invites exploration at every turn, urging your inner creative voice to emerge. The friendly, interactive interface stimulates discovery and spontaneous musical moments, even if you’ve never played an instrument before.\n\nAs many top composers will tell you, playing one note with an inspiring sound is often all it takes to spark a complete idea. GO:KEYS 5 includes over 1000 sounds from Roland’s historic library, which has motivated top music artists in every genre for over 50 years. Journey through a universe of possibilities with the expressive 61-note keyboard, from acoustic pianos and orchestral instruments to modern synthesizers, guitars, drums, and beyond.\n\nOnce you find a sound that energizes you, experiment by creating melodies and arpeggios over automatic musical backing. GO:KEYS 5 is filled with ready-made chord progressions in various styles, all with the immersive sound of a finished record. It’s also possible to craft your own chord sequences, and you can easily find the progressions for your favorite songs online or with dedicated apps.\n\nAs a chord progression loops, discover your own performance style by remixing sounds. Change things up with four variations. Drop parts in and out, including the drums, bass, and backing chords. Swap instruments for a different vibe. And create dynamic energy by processing the entire sound with filtering, lo-fi tones, beat slicing, and other ear-catching performance effects.\n\nAfter you’ve mastered chord progressions, go even further by directing a band of virtual musicians. GO:KEYS 5 offers a wide selection of dynamic accompaniments controlled by one or two left-hand fingers. Jam melodies and solos with your right hand as the band backs every move. Then weave in more sophisticated textures with full left-hand chords as your technique grows.\n\nGO:KEYS 5 also features a microphone input and a large selection of effects to enhance your voice. Sing along with your compositions, complete with studio-style reverb for a polished sound. Magically create real-time harmonies that automatically follow your chords and accompaniment. Or transform your voice with robotic tones that mimic the electronic sounds heard on current pop hits.\n\nAt any time, you can instantly capture what you’re doing with GO:KEYS 5 and listen back. Analyze and hone your ideas. Show off your progress with family and friends. Or share your skills with the world on social media.\n\nWith its portable, all-in-one design, you can pick up GO:KEYS 5 and enjoy music anywhere in your living space. The built-in stereo sound system and passive radiator deliver big sound and powerful bass response, while support for AA battery power makes setup fast and easy. And when you want to play privately, plug in headphones or earbuds to enjoy GO:KEYS 5 without disturbing others.\n\nListening to your favorite music is a great way to inspire the next creative session. Play songs from your music library via Bluetooth, USB memory, or the analog audio inputs and jam along. Then, use the center cancel function to remove the vocals and sing them yourself. GO:KEYS 5 also supports Bluetooth MIDI and audio/MIDI over USB, opening the door to further creative possibilities with music apps on a computer or mobile device.\n\nWant more inspiration? On Roland Cloud, there’s an ever-growing selection of premium sounds and exciting new arranger styles to explore. GO:KEYS 5 also supports Roland Cloud Connect, an optional wireless adapter that lets you browse, audition, and download Roland Cloud content from your smartphone.\n\nWhen you’re ready to take the next step in your musical journey, Melodics Essentials for Roland is the perfect partner to extend the GO:KEYS experience.

      "description": "NOTICE: Beginning November 1, 2024, some Alexa functions are no longer supported with this product.\n\nThis product has provided Alexa-based services through the GO:PIANO Alexa Setup App. However, it has become difficult to maintain stable services in the future, so we have decided to end support for the app. As a result, some Alexa functions detailed on this product page will no longer be available. Other Alexa functions may continue to be available, but operation is not guaranteed. All instrument functions that don’t require Alexa remain operational.\n\nIf you own GO:PIANO with Alexa Built-in and have inquiries regarding this matter, please visit Roland Backstage.\n\n\nGO:PIANO with Alexa Built-in introduces a smart new approach to playing and learning the piano, making the experience easier and more engaging than ever before. This fun portable instrument can be played anywhere around your home and sounds amazing thanks to Roland’s acclaimed piano sound engine. Better still, you can operate nearly every onboard control using just your voice!\n\nWhen playing GO:PIANO with Alexa Built-in, you never have to interrupt the musical flow with fussy button presses or complicated menus. Want to turn on the metronome or choose a different sound? Just ask Alexa! It’s even possible to record your performances and upload them to free cloud storage for playback later. And when you want to play along with your favorite songs, just ask Alexa to queue them up from Amazon Music.\n\nSome Alexa functions detailed above are no longer available due to the discontinuation of support for the GO:PIANO Alexa Setup App.\n\nThis product is not available in all regions. Amazon, Alexa, and all related logos are trademarks of Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.\n\nGO:PIANO with Alexa Built-in makes complicated panel operations a thing of the past. Using just your voice, you can instantly call up any of the 40 onboard sounds, and you never have to take your hands off the keyboard. Many other settings can also be adjusted while staying in the flow, like turning the metronome on/off, changing up the beat, and more.\n\nNOTICE: The voice command functions detailed above are no longer available due to the discontinuation of support for the GO:PIANO Alexa Setup App.\n\nSince it also works as an Alexa-enabled device, GO:PIANO with Alexa Built-in allows you to listen and play along to songs from Amazon Music* through the keyboard’s high-quality sound system. With a huge variety of songs available, you’ll never run out of inspiration for daily music adventures.\n\n*Requires a subscription to Prime Music or Amazon Music Unlimited. Visit the Amazon website for details.\n\nWhen you’ve mastered a piece or composed a new idea, just ask Alexa to record your performance. You can then listen back and evaluate what you’ve done. It’s even possible to upload your recordings to free cloud storage, where they’re always accessible for playback when GO:PIANO with Alexa Built-in is connected via Wi-Fi.\n\nNOTICE: The cloud storage functions detailed above are no longer available due to the discontinuation of support for the GO:PIANO Alexa Setup App.\n\nWith the combined technologies in GO:PIANO with Alexa Built-in, you can fast-track learning like never before. Alexa sharpens your music sensibilities with ear training and builds knowledge with trivia on composers and famous music. And by connecting your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth, you can use Roland’s Piano Partner 2 app to learn music scores and boost your skills with fun exercises and musical games.\n\nGreat tone makes you want to keep playing, and GO:PIANO with Alexa Built-in inspires with expressive sounds derived from Roland’s premium pianos. Each note responds to your touch like a fine acoustic grand, sparking your creativity and stimulating ongoing musical growth. Electric pianos, organs, and many other sounds are also on board, allowing you to expand your musical experience with a world of different styles.\n\nInterested in learning piano but don’t know where to begin? Here is everything you need to know before investing in your new hobby.Read more…\n\nMany of us learned piano when younger and quit. Ensure returning to the piano as an adult is more enjoyable and rewarding.Read more…\n\nConnect, spark joy, and create memories with your family and friends simply by adding a piano to your living space.Read more…\n\nVersatile table-style stand for keyboard instruments.\n\nCarrying bag for GO-61K, GO-61P, GO-PIANO with Alexa. *GO:KEYS 5 and GO:KEYS 3 are not compatible.\n\nMaximize Learning and Enjoyment with This Exclusive Companion App for Your Roland Piano\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "Find a space, grab your smartphone, and start your musical journey with GO:PIANO88.\n\nGO:PIANO88 has 88 full-size keys for authentic playing feel and expressive touch inspired by the keyboards on acoustic grand pianos. Having the full range of notes lets you play more demanding music, and helps develop the correct techniques for both left and right hands. It also ensures a smooth transition should you play a weighted hammer-action keyboard. And even if you invest in a premium piano, your GO:PIANO88 is the ideal portable instrument for slinging in a gigbag and playing at rehearsals, sessions and shows.\n\nGO:PIANO88 pairs with your smartphone to make learning piano fun. Use Bluetooth to connect wirelessly to your smartphone or tablet, then access songs from your music library or try some free online lessons. You can play along as the music streams through the high-quality onboard speakers or your headphones. Or if you’d prefer some more intensive piano training, try some of the many excellent apps or tutorial videos, before you start working with a personal piano teacher.\n\nNot every home has space for a full-size acoustic piano. But the compact design of GO:PIANO88 lets you play in any setting, with all the benefits of 88 full-size keys. Just sit down, switch on and enjoy GO:PIANO88’s full dynamic range, free from setup hassles or tangled wiring. Plus, to ensure you can practice without disturbing others, GO:PIANO88 lets you plug in headphones to play in peace.\n\nAn acoustic piano ties you to one location, while portable electronic keyboards limit the type of music you can play as they have fewer keys. With GO:PIANO88 and a smartphone, you’re ready to make music whenever inspiration strikes. With its compact 7.5kg design and battery-powered operation, GO:PIANO88 lets you perform through its speakers or practice with headphones. Plus, with wireless connectivity to your smartphone, you can work on your skills any time, any place – especially as the 88-note full-size keyboard means your technique won’t be compromised.\n\nAs you appreciate GO:PIANO88‘s 88-note full-size keyboard, you’ll also be inspired by the choice of onboard sounds derived from Roland’s acclaimed premium pianos. Touch the keys and you’ll hear notes full of character, changing seamlessly in response to your touch, just like on a fine acoustic piano. And alongside the expressive keyboard, GO:PIANO88 lets the dynamics of your playing shine through, encouraging you to improve faster as your skills grow. GO:PIANO88 also includes electric pianos, organs, and other sounds so you can explore different musical styles.\n\nGO:PIANO88 helps you focus on playing, with onboard tools that support your daily practice regime. Try the metronome to build your timing skills or experiment by transposing the keyboard to a different musical pitch. Use the onboard recorder to capture your playing and evaluate your progress. And when you’re ready, connecting your smartphone reveals a world of apps and tutorial videos.\n\nWith the 88-note keyboard and tuition features, you’ll soon be playing better than ever – and wanting to share your progress with the world. Although recording videos with your smartphone is easy, the built-in mic doesn’t always sound professional. Instead, try plugging your smartphone and GO:PIANO88 into Roland’s GO:MIXER PRO, to directly capture the great sound while you shoot. You can connect additional sources to GO:MIXER PRO as well, including a mic or another keyboard. With the combination of your smartphone, GO:PIANO88 and GO:MIXER PRO, there’s no simpler way to create pro-quality videos for sharing on social media.\n\nInterested in learning piano but don’t know where to begin?

        "Enjoy Traditional Piano Feel with 88 Standard-Size Keys\n\nGO:PIANO88 has 88 full-size keys for authentic playing feel and expressive touch inspired by the keyboards on acoustic grand pianos. Having the full range of notes lets you play more demanding music, and helps develop the correct techniques for both left and right hands. It also ensures a smooth transition should you play a weighted hammer-action keyboard. And even if you invest in a premium piano, your GO:PIANO88 is the ideal portable instrument for slinging in a gigbag and playing at rehearsals, sessions and shows.",
        "Connect Wirelessly To Your Smartphone, Access Online Content and Learn Faster\n\nGO:PIANO88 pairs with your smartphone to make learning piano fun. Use Bluetooth to connect wirelessly to your smartphone or tablet, then access songs from your music library or try some free online lessons. You can play along as the music streams through the high-quality onboard speakers or your headphones. Or if you’d prefer some more intensive piano training, try some of the many excellent apps or tutorial videos, before you start working with a personal piano teacher.",
        "Enjoy Authentic Piano Performance with a Compact, Space-Saving Footprint\n\nNot every home has space for a full-size acoustic piano. But the compact design of GO:PIANO88 lets you play in any setting, with all the benefits of 88 full-size keys. Just sit down, switch on and enjoy GO:PIANO88’s full dynamic range, free from setup hassles or tangled wiring. Plus, to ensure you can practice without disturbing others, GO:PIANO88 lets you plug in headphones to play in peace.",
        "Make Music on the Move with Battery Power and a Wireless Smartphone Connection\n\nAn acoustic piano ties you to one location, while portable electronic keyboards limit the type of music you can play as they have fewer keys. With GO:PIANO88 and a smartphone, you’re ready to make music whenever inspiration strikes. With its compact 7.5kg design and battery-powered operation, GO:PIANO88 lets you perform through its speakers or practice with headphones. Plus, with wireless connectivity to your smartphone, you can work on your skills any time, any place – especially as the 88-note full-size keyboard means your technique won’t be compromised.",
        "Get Inspired with Roland’s Responsive Piano Sounds\n\nAs you appreciate GO:PIANO88‘s 88-note full-size keyboard, you’ll also be inspired by the choice of onboard sounds derived from Roland’s acclaimed premium pianos. Touch the keys and you’ll hear notes full of character, changing seamlessly in response to your touch, just like on a fine acoustic piano. And alongside the expressive keyboard, GO:PIANO88 lets the dynamics of your playing shine through, encouraging you to improve faster as your skills grow. GO:PIANO88 also includes electric pianos, organs, and other sounds so you can explore different musical styles.",
        "Get More from Your Practice Sessions with Onboard Learning Features\n\nGO:PIANO88 helps you focus on playing, with onboard tools that support your daily practice regime. Try the metronome to build your timing skills or experiment by transposing the keyboard to a different musical pitch. Use the onboard recorder to capture your playing and evaluate your progress. And when you’re ready, connecting your smartphone reveals a world of apps and tutorial videos.",
        "Create High-Quality Videos with Your Smartphone and GO:MIXER PRO\n\nWith the 88-note keyboard and tuition features, you’ll soon be playing better than ever – and wanting to share your progress with the world. Although recording videos with your smartphone is easy, the built-in mic doesn’t always sound professional. Instead, try plugging your smartphone and GO:PIANO88 into Roland’s GO:MIXER PRO, to directly capture the great sound while you shoot. You can connect additional sources to GO:MIXER PRO as well, including a mic or another keyboard. With the combination of your smartphone, GO:PIANO88 and GO:MIXER PRO, there’s no simpler way to create pro-quality videos for sharing on social media."

      "description": "With its retro workflow, evocative sounds, and powerful effects, the JD-800 was a favorite for top electronic music producers through the ’90s and beyond. Combining the original JD-800 waveforms with advanced modeling techniques, the JD-08 delivers the exquisite hands-on sound design of the original, along with hugely expanded polyphony, a two-part polyphonic sequencer, and other modern updates.\n\nBy the early ’90s, preset-driven digital synths with limited hands-on controls dominated the landscape. The JD-800 changed all that in 1991, bringing the synthesizer world back to its roots with a control-laden panel and an aggressively electronic sound palette. The JD-08 includes 64 presets from the original hardware and perfectly recreates the four-tone structure, 108 waveforms, and unique two-part multi-effects that are at the core of the JD-800’s intricate, evolving sound.\n\nWhile the original design of the JD-800 is retained in this modern version, there are a range of updates that take the experience to another level. New patches plus 256 memory locations let you dive deep into the huge array of controls to create new sounds for your music. And with expanded polyphony and two-part multitimbral capability, there’s even more room to stretch out your sonic ideas.\n\nOnce you’ve locked in your patches, fire up the two-part polyphonic sequencer and start programming leads, basslines, or basic chords to sync with other pieces in your electronic ensemble. And to bring some animated movement to your sounds, tap into motion recording and the onboard arpeggiator to make your musical lines dance.\n\nThe JD-08 features a built-in USB-C audio/MIDI interface, so you can play, record, and synchronize with all types of computer production software. Full-size MIDI I/O is also available for interfacing with other MIDI hardware. There’s even an external clock input for driving the JD-08’s onboard sequencer and arpeggiator from vintage analog instruments and modern Eurorack systems.\n\nThe compact JD-08 fits just about anywhere and is easily controlled from a master keyboard or computer DAW. It can run on standard AA batteries for hours of uninhibited jamming, and there’s also a built-in speaker for on-the-go sound monitoring. Add a DK-01 Boutique Dock for a polished look and three convenient tilt positions, or grab a K-25m Keyboard Unit to create a fully self-contained, portable instrument.\n\nThe enigmatic artist reveals how he creates his noir masterpieces and how the element of chance contributed to his runaway viral success.Read more…\n\nFrom Africa to the United Kingdom, eclectic dance star Junior Simba shares his passion for infusing ethnic sounds into his songcraft.Read more…\n\nRoland Boutique is a world of instruments that inspire electronic music creativity by expanding on the legendary sounds of the past with a workflow to suit the modern producer and musician.Read more…\n\nThe K-25m is a 25-key, velocity sensitive keyboard designed for use with the Roland Boutique series.\n\nRoland Boutique module case with integrated tilt stand.\n\nCarrying bag for one Roland Boutique module.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

      "description": "Three legendary Roland synths, now available as affordable, limited-edition sound modules.\n\nWatch Jori talk about the Aira range and get his reaction to the brand new Boutique synths.\n\nWhat is Roland Boutique?\n\nRoland catches up with some of electronic music’s movers and shakers at this year’s ADE festival in Amsterdam, discovering how they started with Roland and how they’ve opened their arms, studios and live rigs to our next generation AIRA range and Roland Boutique classic synths.\n\nThe JUPITER-8 was a big synth in every way; physically imposing with loads of knobs and sliders, and most importantly, a huge sound. The JP-08 retains the big sound of the JUPITER-8 but shrinks everything else – including the price – into a module measuring under 12” across.\n\nWith such an expressive sound engine, you’ll want to shape the sounds to match your mood. With 36 of the original parameters accessible from the front panel, the JP-08 is all about hands-on control, and even users of the JUPITER-8 will quickly feel at home as the user interface and programming ‘feel’ is highly reminiscent of the original.\n\nEven though the JP-08 is an authentic recreation of the JUPITER-8, we also included a few extras. The JP-08 adds several new waveforms to the original architecture, including TRI and NOISE for the LFO and SIN for VCO-1, and both VCOs have an expanded range for even more sound shaping potential.\n\nThe onboard 16-step sequencer is a sonic scratchpad that lets you try out new ideas without bringing lots of gear – it can even be used without a keyboard. And if there’s no keyboard connected, the ribbon controller lets you preview the sound, making it an ideal way to program patches quickly and easily.\n\nThe JP-08 works especially well with the K-25m, an optional 25-key velocity sensitive keyboard that takes your music making to the next level. Once docked in the keyboard, the module’s front panel adjusts to three positions for convenient access to the knobs and sliders.\n\nOne of the killer features of the original JUPITER-8 was its ability to create huge pads, splits and layers using its 8 voices of polyphony. The JP-08 features a chain mode that allows you to connect two JP-08 modules using the MIDI ports and create one, 8-voice synthesizer, just like the original. Adding additional modules adds another 4 voices of polyphony with each module. This is especially great when controlling the JP-08 from a larger external keyboard. You can even edit the sound from the master module and control both units. Great for realtime filter sweeps and LFO effects.\n\nSome of the best music is made away from the studio, so the Roland Boutique series runs on 4 x AA batteries, ready for when inspiration strikes. Alternatively, you can power the JP-08 via USB bus power.\n\nThe built-in USB port also functions as a high-quality 24bit, 44.1 kHz audio interface, for a fast, simple and reliable way of recording directly to your DAW application. You can keep your favorite patches and sequencer patterns safe too, via the USB data backup function.\n\nThree legendary Roland synths, now available as affordable, limited-edition sound modules.\n\nFor these Edmonton synth provocateurs, punk is more than a genre.

      "features": [
        "Huge Synth. Small Package.\n\nThe JUPITER-8 was a big synth in every way; physically imposing with loads of knobs and sliders, and most importantly, a huge sound. The JP-08 retains the big sound of the JUPITER-8 but shrinks everything else – including the price – into a module measuring under 12” across.",
        "Hands-On Control\n\nWith such an expressive sound engine, you’ll want to shape the sounds to match your mood. With 36 of the original parameters accessible from the front panel, the JP-08 is all about hands-on control, and even users of the JUPITER-8 will quickly feel at home as the user interface and programming ‘feel’ is highly reminiscent of the original.",
        "New Sound-Shaping Options\n\nEven though the JP-08 is an authentic recreation of the JUPITER-8, we also included a few extras. The JP-08 adds several new waveforms to the original architecture, including TRI and NOISE for the LFO and SIN for VCO-1, and both VCOs have an expanded range for even more sound shaping potential.",
        "Develop Your Ideas with a 16-Step Sequencer\n\nThe onboard 16-step sequencer is a sonic scratchpad that lets you try out new ideas without bringing lots of gear – it can even be used without a keyboard. And if there’s no keyboard connected, the ribbon controller lets you preview the sound, making it an ideal way to program patches quickly and easily.",
        "Optional K-25m Keyboard Unit\n\nThe JP-08 works especially well with the K-25m, an optional 25-key velocity sensitive keyboard that takes your music making to the next level. Once docked in the keyboard, the module’s front panel adjusts to three positions for convenient access to the knobs and sliders.",
        "Chain Mode\n\nOne of the killer features of the original JUPITER-8 was its ability to create huge pads, splits and layers using its 8 voices of polyphony. The JP-08 features a chain mode that allows you to connect two JP-08 modules using the MIDI ports and create one, 8-voice synthesizer, just like the original. Adding additional modules adds another 4 voices of polyphony with each module. This is especially great when controlling the JP-08 from a larger external keyboard. You can even edit the sound from the master module and control both units. Great for realtime filter sweeps and LFO effects.",
        "Battery or USB Bus Power\n\nSome of the best music is made away from the studio, so the Roland Boutique series runs on 4 x AA batteries, ready for when inspiration strikes. Alternatively, you can power the JP-08 via USB bus power.",
        "USB Audio Interface for Direct Recording into Your DAW\n\nThe built-in USB port also functions as a high-quality 24bit, 44.1 kHz audio interface, for a fast, simple and reliable way of recording directly to your DAW application. You can keep your favorite patches and sequencer patterns safe too, via the USB data backup function."

      "description": "Three legendary Roland synths, now available as affordable, limited-edition sound modules.\n\nWatch Jori talk about the Aira range and get his reaction to the brand new Boutique synths.\n\nWhat is Roland Boutique?\n\nRoland catches up with some of electronic music’s movers and shakers at this year’s ADE festival in Amsterdam, discovering how they started with Roland and how they’ve opened their arms, studios and live rigs to our next generation AIRA range and Roland Boutique classic synths.\n\nThe JUNO-106 is sometimes described as one of the last great synths of the analog era, and it became a firm favorite thanks to its distinctive, warm sounds and instant sound shaping ability. The new JU-06 module has all of the sonic character of the original, with accurate reproduction of the entire sound set including the classic JUNO strings and the much-loved JUNO chorus effect.\n\nThe original JUNO-106 was a great way to learn about synthesis, as each stage of the sound creation process was clearly laid out on the front panel, with lots of sliders for instant sound-shaping and experimentation. And that’s still the case with the JU-06, which features 23 knobs and sliders from the original – all inviting you to start tweaking and creating your own customized version of this legendary sound engine.\n\nLike the other members of the Roland Boutique range, we also added a few subtle improvements that weren’t found on the original models. The JU-06 gains a faster LFO and a continuously variable hi-pass filter (HPF) resulting in a super-smooth sound.\n\nThe onboard 16-step sequencer is a sonic scratchpad that lets you try out new ideas without bringing lots of gear – it can even be used without a keyboard. And if there’s no keyboard connected, the ribbon controller lets you preview the sound, making it an ideal way to program patches quickly and easily.\n\nThe JU-06 works especially well with the K-25m, an optional 25-key velocity sensitive keyboard that takes your music making to the next level. Once docked in the keyboard, the module’s front panel adjusts to three positions for convenient access to the knobs and sliders.\n\nThe original JUNO-106 was famous for big lush sounds created by its 6 oscillators/voices. The JU-06 features a chain mode that allows you to connect two JU-06 modules using the MIDI ports and create one, 8-voice synthesizer. Adding additional modules adds another 4 voices of polyphony with each module. This is especially great when controlling the JU-08 from a larger external keyboard. You can even edit the sound from the master module and control both units. Great for realtime filter sweeps and envelope adjustments.\n\nSome of the best music is made away from the studio, so the Roland Boutique series runs on 4 x AA batteries, ready for when inspiration strikes. Alternatively, you can power the JU-06 via USB Bus power.\n\nThe built-in USB port also functions as a high-quality 24bit, 44.1 kHz audio interface, for a fast, simple and reliable way of recording directly to your DAW application. You can keep your favorite patches and sequencer patterns safe too, via the USB data backup function.\n\nThree legendary Roland synths, now available as affordable, limited-edition sound modules.\n\nThe enigmatic artist reveals how he creates his noir masterpieces and how the element of chance contributed to his runaway viral success.Read more…\n\nA group of eclectic Icelandic artists offer unique perspectives on electronic music performance, their home country, and more.Read more…\n\nThe JUNO architecture and circuits make it perfect for creating thick analog bass lines.

        "Big Sound. Small Package.\n\nThe JUNO-106 is sometimes described as one of the last great synths of the analog era, and it became a firm favorite thanks to its distinctive, warm sounds and instant sound shaping ability. The new JU-06 module has all of the sonic character of the original, with accurate reproduction of the entire sound set including the classic JUNO strings and the much-loved JUNO chorus effect.",
        "Hands-On Control for Instant Programming\n\nThe original JUNO-106 was a great way to learn about synthesis, as each stage of the sound creation process was clearly laid out on the front panel, with lots of sliders for instant sound-shaping and experimentation. And that’s still the case with the JU-06, which features 23 knobs and sliders from the original – all inviting you to start tweaking and creating your own customized version of this legendary sound engine.",
        "Additional Sound-Shaping Options\n\nLike the other members of the Roland Boutique range, we also added a few subtle improvements that weren’t found on the original models. The JU-06 gains a faster LFO and a continuously variable hi-pass filter (HPF) resulting in a super-smooth sound.",
        "Develop Your Ideas with A 16-Step Sequencer\n\nThe onboard 16-step sequencer is a sonic scratchpad that lets you try out new ideas without bringing lots of gear – it can even be used without a keyboard. And if there’s no keyboard connected, the ribbon controller lets you preview the sound, making it an ideal way to program patches quickly and easily.",
        "Optional K-25m Keyboard Unit\n\nThe JU-06 works especially well with the K-25m, an optional 25-key velocity sensitive keyboard that takes your music making to the next level. Once docked in the keyboard, the module’s front panel adjusts to three positions for convenient access to the knobs and sliders.",
        "Chain Mode\n\nThe original JUNO-106 was famous for big lush sounds created by its 6 oscillators/voices. The JU-06 features a chain mode that allows you to connect two JU-06 modules using the MIDI ports and create one, 8-voice synthesizer. Adding additional modules adds another 4 voices of polyphony with each module. This is especially great when controlling the JU-08 from a larger external keyboard. You can even edit the sound from the master module and control both units. Great for realtime filter sweeps and envelope adjustments.",
        "Battery or USB Bus Power\n\nSome of the best music is made away from the studio, so the Roland Boutique series runs on 4 x AA batteries, ready for when inspiration strikes. Alternatively, you can power the JU-06 via USB Bus power.",
        "USB Audio Interface for Direct Recording into Your DAW\n\nThe built-in USB port also functions as a high-quality 24bit, 44.1 kHz audio interface, for a fast, simple and reliable way of recording directly to your DAW application. You can keep your favorite patches and sequencer patterns safe too, via the USB data backup function."

      "description": "For many, vintage Roland JUNO synthesizers define the sound of the ‘80s. Increasingly popular on the used market, many keyboardists either want one, or deeply regret selling one back in the day. With the JU-06A you get the sound, look, and features of both the JUNO-60 and JUNO-106 in one reliable, modern instrument that you can take anywhere.\n\nThe JU-06A is compact, yet comfortable for long studio sessions and epic live performances. It runs on batteries and has a handy built-in speaker, so JUNO goes where you go. The tough metal panels and smooth sliders with metal shafts feel great and stand up to the rigors of life on the road (even if it's just your daily commute). And it totally looks the part, with the authentic vintage styling we all know and love.\n\nThe JU-06A is the best of the JUNO-60 and JUNO-106 in one synth. It has the continuous high-pass filter of the 106, the envelope-controllable pulse-width-modulation of the 60, and the unique filter behavior of both, instantly switchable from the front panel. The sound is indistinguishable from its vintage counterparts, even while tweaking controls or using extreme settings. And no vintage JUNO would be complete without the swirling sound of its legendary chorus, faithfully recreated, right down to the lovable (and thankfully adjustable) noise.\n\nWhile you may prefer the filter of the JUNO-106, you might miss the arpeggio function on the JUNO-60. The JU-06A has both—and throws in chord memory and an onboard sequencer to boot. Creating sequenced lines with chord memory results in polyphonic phrases so thick they have no business coming from something that fits in your backpack.\n\nWith USB audio/MIDI and full-sized MIDI jacks, you play and synchronize with just about any piece of gear. There’s also an external clock input, so you can sync to vintage analog instruments or modern Eurorack systems. Not only is this convenient, but using external clock to drive the onboard sequencer can result in unexpected phrases, rhythmic variations, and other happy accidents.\n\nIts compact size means the JU-06A fits just about anywhere, easily controlled from a master keyboard or DAW. Add a DK-01 Boutique Dock for a polished look and three convenient tilt positions. Or add a K-25m Keyboard Unit and you have a totally self-contained, portable instrument offering an unleashed experience free of wires and other complications.\n\nThe JU-06A is the best of the JUNO-60 and JUNO-106 in one synth. It has the continuous high-pass filter of the 106, the envelope-controllable pulse-width-modulation of the 60, and the unique filter behavior of both, instantly switchable from the front panel.\n\nThe enigmatic artist reveals how he creates his noir masterpieces and how the element of chance contributed to his runaway viral success.Read more…\n\nOctave One’s Lenny Burden reveals the tools and techniques behind the duo’s tactile, electrifying live sets.Read more…\n\nThe JUNO architecture and circuits make it perfect for creating thick analog bass lines. Learn to create five different bass sounds with the classic synth.Read more…\n\nRoland Boutique is a world of instruments that inspire electronic music creativity by expanding on the legendary sounds of the past with a workflow to suit the modern producer and musician.Read more…\n\nThe K-25m is a 25-key, velocity sensitive keyboard designed for use with the Roland Boutique series.\n\nRoland Boutique module case with integrated tilt stand.\n\nCarrying bag for one Roland Boutique module.\n\nCompatible with Apple Mac series (Intel-based).\nCompatible with Apple Silicon Mac (using the M1 chip).\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.\n\nCompatible with Apple Mac series (Intel-based).\nCompatible with Apple Silicon Mac (using the M1 chip).",

      "description": "Three legendary Roland synths, now available as affordable, limited-edition sound modules.\n\nWatch Jori talk about the Aira range and get his reaction to the brand new Boutique synths.\n\nWhat is Roland Boutique?\n\nRoland catches up with some of electronic music’s movers and shakers at this year’s ADE festival in Amsterdam, discovering how they started with Roland and how they’ve opened their arms, studios and live rigs to our next generation AIRA range and Roland Boutique classic synths.\n\nOften described as a forgotten classic, the JX-3P was all about instant access to big sounds, with a simple button-driven interface rather than lots of knobs and sliders. When used with the optional PG-200 controller however, the power of the highly programmable engine was revealed. The new JX-03 module recreates the panel layout of the PG-200 – including all 24 knobs - giving direct and instant access to the versatile synth architecture.\n\nLike the other members of the Roland Boutique range, we also added a few subtle improvements that weren’t found on the original models. The JX-03 benefits from extra waveforms and extended range for both DCOs as well as extra waveforms for the LFO. The second DCO also gets extra cross modulation options. These additions further expand the sound creation possibilities of the battle-tested JX engine.\n\nThe onboard 16-step sequencer is a sonic scratchpad that lets you try out new ideas without bringing lots of gear – it can even be used without a keyboard. And if there’s no keyboard connected, the ribbon controller lets you preview the sound, making it an ideal way to program patches quickly and easily.\n\nThe JX-03 works especially well with the K-25m, an optional 25-key velocity sensitive keyboard that takes your music making to the next level. Once docked in the keyboard, the module’s front panel can be tilted for convenient access to the knobs and sliders.\n\nThe original JX-3P was a powerful synth featuring 2 digitally controlled oscillators for each of its 6 voices. The JX-03 features a chain mode that allows you to connect two JX-03 modules using the MIDI ports and create one, 8-voice synthesizer. Adding additional modules adds another 4 voices of polyphony with each module. This is especially great when controlling the JX-03 from a larger external keyboard. You can even edit the sound from the master module and control both units. Great for realtime filter sweeps and envelope adjustments.\n\nSome of the best music is made away from the studio, so the module runs on 4 x AA batteries, ready for when inspiration strikes. Alternatively, you can power the JX-03 via USB bus power.\n\nThe built-in USB port also functions as a high-quality 24bit, 44.1 kHz audio interface, for a fast, simple and reliable way of recording directly to your DAW application. You can keep your favorite patches and sequencer patterns safe too, via the USB data backup function.\n\nThree legendary Roland synths, now available as affordable, limited-edition sound modules.\n\nThe enigmatic artist reveals how he creates his noir masterpieces and how the element of chance contributed to his runaway viral success.Read more…\n\nThe lead engineers discuss the creation of the Roland Boutique series.Read more…\n\nVeteran Roland engineers share the development stories behind the classic synths that the Roland Boutique modules are based on.Read more…\n\nThe K-25m is a 25-key, velocity sensitive keyboard designed for use with the Roland Boutique series.\n\nCarrying bag for one Roland Boutique module.\n\nThis contains information on the Boutique driver compatible with Microsoft Windows 10.\n\nThis is the Boutique driver for Microsoft Windows 8.1 / 8 / 7.\n\nCompatible with Apple Mac series (Intel-based).\nCompatible with Apple Silicon Mac (using the M1 chip).\n\nThis is the Boutique driver for macOS 10.12 / OS X 10.11.\n\nThis is the Boutique driver for OS X 10.9 / OS X 10.10.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.\n\nCompatible with Apple Mac series (Intel-based).\nCompatible with Apple Silicon Mac (using the M1 chip).",

        "JX-3P Sound. Built-In Controller.\n\nOften described as a forgotten classic, the JX-3P was all about instant access to big sounds, with a simple button-driven interface rather than lots of knobs and sliders. When used with the optional PG-200 controller however, the power of the highly programmable engine was revealed. The new JX-03 module recreates the panel layout of the PG-200 – including all 24 knobs - giving direct and instant access to the versatile synth architecture.",
        "Additional Sound-Shaping Options\n\nLike the other members of the Roland Boutique range, we also added a few subtle improvements that weren’t found on the original models. The JX-03 benefits from extra waveforms and extended range for both DCOs as well as extra waveforms for the LFO. The second DCO also gets extra cross modulation options. These additions further expand the sound creation possibilities of the battle-tested JX engine.",
        "Develop Your Ideas with A 16-Step Sequencer\n\nThe onboard 16-step sequencer is a sonic scratchpad that lets you try out new ideas without bringing lots of gear – it can even be used without a keyboard. And if there’s no keyboard connected, the ribbon controller lets you preview the sound, making it an ideal way to program patches quickly and easily.",
        "Works With Optional K-25m Keyboard Unit\n\nThe JX-03 works especially well with the K-25m, an optional 25-key velocity sensitive keyboard that takes your music making to the next level. Once docked in the keyboard, the module’s front panel can be tilted for convenient access to the knobs and sliders.",
        "Chain Mode\n\nThe original JX-3P was a powerful synth featuring 2 digitally controlled oscillators for each of its 6 voices. The JX-03 features a chain mode that allows you to connect two JX-03 modules using the MIDI ports and create one, 8-voice synthesizer. Adding additional modules adds another 4 voices of polyphony with each module. This is especially great when controlling the JX-03 from a larger external keyboard. You can even edit the sound from the master module and control both units. Great for realtime filter sweeps and envelope adjustments.",
        "Battery or USB Bus Power\n\nSome of the best music is made away from the studio, so the module runs on 4 x AA batteries, ready for when inspiration strikes. Alternatively, you can power the JX-03 via USB bus power.",
        "USB Audio Interface for Direct Recording into Your DAW\n\nThe built-in USB port also functions as a high-quality 24bit, 44.1 kHz audio interface, for a fast, simple and reliable way of recording directly to your DAW application. You can keep your favorite patches and sequencer patterns safe too, via the USB data backup function."

      "description": "In 1985, Roland’s innovative JX-8P took hybrid synthesis a step further with a compelling new analog-digital voice. The instrument was instantly embraced by top session players, who forever embedded its warm pads, shimmery chorus, and crystalline textures into the era’s most popular tracks. The JX-08 reintroduces the unique sound of this sought-after classic in stunning detail, coupled with powerful new effects, a polyphonic sequencer, and more. And to enhance your creative flow, there’s a full panel of hands-on controls derived from the companion PG-800 programmer unit for the original hardware.\n\nWhile the original design of the JX-8P is retained in this modern version, we’ve added a range of updates that take the experience to another level. Explore the 100-plus new patches tuned for contemporary styles, or use the onboard controls to design your own sounds. And with expanded polyphony, two-part multitimbral capability, and dual/split modes, there’s even more room to stretch out your sonic ideas. Once you’ve found your zone, store your creations for easy recall using any of the 256 preset slots.\n\nThe JX-08 comes stocked with 17 powerful effects, many of which are new to the Roland Boutique range. Add some gloss to your JX patches with classic chorus, phaser, and delay options, or get gritty with overdrive, fuzz, bit crusher, and the new lo-fi compressor. Filters and pitch shifters are also available to bring additional dimension and character to your sounds.\n\nOnce you’ve locked in your patches, fire up the two-part polyphonic sequencer and start programming leads, basslines, or basic chords to sync with other pieces in your electronic ensemble. And to bring some animated movement to your sounds, tap into motion recording and the onboard arpeggiator to make your musical lines dance.\n\nThe JX-08 features a built-in USB-C audio/MIDI interface, so you can play, record, and synchronize with all types of computer production software. Full-size MIDI I/O is also available for interfacing with other MIDI hardware. There’s even an external clock input for driving the JX-08’s onboard sequencer and arpeggiator from vintage analog instruments and modern Eurorack systems.\n\nThe compact JX-08 fits just about anywhere and is easily controlled from a master keyboard or computer DAW. It can run on standard AA batteries for hours of uninhibited jamming, and there’s also a built-in speaker for on-the-go sound monitoring. Add a DK-01 Boutique Dock for a polished look and three convenient tilt positions, or grab a K-25m Keyboard Unit to create a fully self-contained, portable instrument.\n\nThe enigmatic artist reveals how he creates his noir masterpieces and how the element of chance contributed to his runaway viral success.Read more…\n\nTravel back in time to the year 1985 to find out what makes the JX-8P so unique among the Roland polysynths and why it remains so beloved.Read more…\n\nRoland Boutique is a world of instruments that inspire electronic music creativity by expanding on the legendary sounds of the past with a workflow to suit the modern producer and musician.Read more…\n\nThe K-25m is a 25-key, velocity sensitive keyboard designed for use with the Roland Boutique series.\n\nRoland Boutique module case with integrated tilt stand.\n\nCarrying bag for one Roland Boutique module.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

The MC-101 GROOVEBOX has all the high-quality sounds, sequencing, and effects of the expansive MC-707 in a compact four-track version that’s go-everywhere portable. Get started with an inspiring collection of ready-to-go sounds and patterns, or easily create your own. Craft a unique style by importing custom sounds, loops, and clips that sync to tempo. And you can perform with the MC-101, triggering clips and shaping your sounds with direct, hands-on control.\n\nThe MC-101 is a professional production tool, sharing the sounds and many of the capabilities of its bigger sibling, the MC-707. And there are advantages to being small. The MC-101 is solid-yet-light and runs for about five hours on four AA batteries, so you can design sounds, create drum patterns, and compose musical phrases just about anywhere. And it’s not just a scratch pad for simple ideas. You can produce fully fledged professional tracks or create backing tracks and accompaniment for live performance.\n\nThe MC-101 has a four-track sequencer optimized for creating today’s electronic and dance-focused music. You can use the 16 RGB pads to create drum, bass, and synthesizer patterns and produce your own original music. Explore a musical playground where you can freely combine loops and one-shots with melodic phrases, including your own MIDI sequences and imported audio recordings. Compose and chain scenes or clips, rearrange, re-sample, record automation, and more. Or share clips with other MC-101, MC-707, and VERSELAB MV-1 users for remote collaboration.\n\nThe MC-101 uses the ZEN-Core Synthesis System—the most advanced synth engine we’ve ever made. ZEN-Core delivers the Roland sounds that have defined electronic and dance genres for over forty years. Legendary instruments like the TR-808, TR-909, JUNO-106, and SH-101 are all here, ready to replicate classic sounds or be combined, tweaked, and processed into entirely new sounds.\nMore About ZEN-Core\n\nCompose from a curated collection of projects with built-in beats, phrases, and sounds, all expertly crafted by renowned artists and sound designers—with even more available to download.\nExplore Projects\n\nThe MC-101 is also compatible with ZEN-Core Sound Packs. So when you’re ready for more sounds, or want to explore new genres and styles, it’s easy to change things up.\nExplore Sounds\n\nEach track contains a powerful sample player so you can import your own custom sounds. Use your own voice or the sound of a favorite instrument from your computer. Imported audio can sync with the MC-101’s tempo or be processed with the arsenal of built-in effects and hands-on controls.\n\nWith the MC-101’s wide range of pro effects, your music sounds polished and fully produced. Each track has independent effects processors with a huge number of variations. Lush chorus brings depth to pads and other synth sounds. Delays and reverbs create evocative spaces and add movement to delicate sequences. Overdrive, distortion, and amp simulation inject grit and intensity into synths, guitars, drums, and more. You can also run your entire mix through master effects like filters, bit-crushers, and a master bus compressor that glues it all together with punch and clarity.\n\nWhen you’re ready to develop tracks further or share your creations with friends and fans, simply connect the MC-101 to your computer with a single USB cable. It has advanced USB audio interface capabilities and can record an entire mix or all four parts to individual tracks in your DAW. Or sample sounds from your DAW to capture backing tracks, stems, or the sound of a favorite software synth for your next live show.\n\nThe MC-101 GROOVEBOX has all the high-quality sounds, sequencing, and effects of the professional MC-707, in a compact four-track version that’s go-everywhere portable.\n\nIn this video, Peter Brown gives you an overview of the beatmaking possibilities of the Roland MC-101. This overview looks at some of the sounds and performance techniques to get you making music anywhere.\n\nDrummer, DJ, and electronic visionary Rusty Egan helped shape Britain's New Romantic pulse—from Visage's \"Fade to Grey\" to the Blitz Club.Read more…\n\nJamie Stewart, the confessional frontperson of experimental rock band Xiu Xiu, explains their love for Roland drum machines.Read more…\n\nStrand of Oaks mastermind Timothy Showalter explains how painting and meditation fueled his shift from folk rock to synth sounds.Read more…\n\nThe GROOVEBOX series continues to evolve, and one of the latest tools for advanced performance is Scene Chain.

      "description": "The MC-707 GROOVEBOX has everything you need to create a song or perform a live set without a computer. Immerse yourself in eight tracks of recording, sequencing, synthesizers, and effects, plus a curated palette of sounds, loops, and phrases. Record audio and MIDI—with deep control over timing—and tweak the faders and knobs for that “in the moment” experience. With such massive potential, you’re ready to produce in any style or create your own new thing.\n\nThis modern GROOVEBOX packs a lot of punch in a single piece of gear. It’s deep and customizable, yet fun and friendly, always ready to create something new. Compose from a curated collection of built-in sounds, beats, and phrases all expertly crafted by renowned artists and sound designers. Explore a musical playground where you can freely combine loops and one-shots with melodic phrases, including your own audio recordings and MIDI sequences. Record and share clips, chain Scenes, re-arrange, re-sample, record automation, and make it all sound huge with per-track and global effects.\n\nThe MC-707’s eight-track sequencer is optimized for fluid production of today’s electronic-focused music styles. Quickly build parts with the TR-REC step sequencer found on classic Roland drum machines and use the 16 ultra-sensitive pads to play and record drum parts, melodic basslines, or polyphonic chord progressions. Sequences are stored in clips that contain your sounds and note data, plus real-time or drawn automation for creating effect changes, slow filter sweeps, and much more. You can capture clips in Scenes to perform complete songs, and use creative tools like note repeat, chord designer, and step LFO to supercharge new ideas.\n\nThe MC-707 lets you dig deep into our most advanced synth engine ever—the ZEN-Core Synthesis System. Fusing virtual analog, modeling, and modern PCM, the MC-707 has the sounds of legendary Roland rhythm machines and synthesizers that are the foundation of electronic music, including the TR-808, TR-909, TB-303, JUNO-106, and SH-101. But the MC-707 also looks forward, with modern digital and hybrid sounds perfect for creating future classics today.\nMore About ZEN-Core\n\nIn addition to its deep synthesis engine, the MC-707 has a powerful sampler with on-the-fly recording that synchronizes to your project’s tempo. Record vocals or instrument parts, or import from your own existing library, then sequence or trigger phrases, one-shots, and loops. You can also tweak and mangle samples by slicing, truncating, and reversing—with the inspiration and precision that comes only from hands-on control.\n\nWith the MC-707’s massive effects palette, your music sounds polished and fully produced. All eight tracks have independent effects processors with a huge number of variations. Lush chorus brings depth to pads and other synth sounds. Delays and reverbs create evocative spaces and add movement to delicate sequences. Overdrive, distortion, and amp simulation inject grit and intensity into synths, guitars, drums, and more. You can process external audio and run your entire mix through master effects like filters, bit-crushers, and a master bus compressor that glues it all together with punch and clarity.\n\nLoaded with tactile controls, the MC-707 lets you dig in and shape your music in a visceral, physical way. Faders for each track let you immediately mix and arrange parts, and knobs can be freely assigned to any control you need. You can even record your knob movements so they play back automatically. And the 8x2 pad array is not only great for playing drums and triggering clips—you can generate repeating rhythms, create melodies, constrain to any kind of scale, and trigger complex chords.\n\nWith its advanced USB audio interface capabilities, the MC-707 easily flows in and out of your production setup. You can record all eight parts to individual DAW tracks and finish your song there. Or sample sounds from your DAW to capture backing tracks, stems, or the sound of a favorite software synth for your next live show.\n\nThe MC-707 is an updateable and expandable platform that never gets stale. Keep things fresh with projects that contain new loops, one-shots, phrases, and synth sounds—all available online.\nExplore Projects\n\nAnd since the MC-707 uses the ZEN-Core Synthesis System, you can get loads of new sounds with ZEN-Core Sound Packs, available via Roland Cloud Manager.\nExplore Sounds\n\nThe MC-707 GROOVEBOX has everything you need to create a song or perform a live set without a computer.

      "description": "The P-6 Creative Sampler packs renowned Roland sampling technology into a pocket-size gadget with sophisticated granular sound design options and a powerful sequencer. Equipped with an onboard mic, intuitive controls, USB-C connectivity, and a versatile stash of hands-on MFX, the P-6 delivers exceptional sampling and performance capabilities anywhere you go.\n\nThe P-6 is ideal for any level of music creator, from beginner to pro. Get started right away with top-level tactile controls and pads for jamming and sound tweaking. Then, go deeper with advanced features for cutting-edge sonic manipulation and performance.\n\nWhether using the built-in mic, analog inputs, or a smartphone via USB-C, the P-6 is always ready to sample at a moment’s notice. After capturing sounds, quickly chop longer samples into preset sections for triggering from the onboard keyboard. Or easily build custom collections of multiple sounds with streamlined Step Sampling. Want to rough up the sound? Get gritty with our trademark lo-fi effects. Need some layers? Resample your creations to add depth and evolving complexity.\n\nStep into a universe of microscopic sound design with the advanced granular sampling tools in the P-6. Transform tiny moments into sonic landscapes with extensive sound design parameters. Detune samples, adjust the grain shape, play with head position, head speed, spread, and more. From clean and pristine to beautifully mangled, it’s easy to conjure new sound dimensions with a twist of a knob or a press of a button.\n\nBreathe life into your sequences with deep features that push the boundaries of music programming. Jam with 64-step patterns powered by dynamic sequencing elements like motion recording, probability, micro-timing, off-grid sequencing, and sub steps. Plus, manipulate playback in real-time with Step Loop for instant stutter effects and creative improvisation.\n\nSupercharge performances and production with an array of curated, hands-on MFX. Transform and manipulate your sounds with legendary effects and a selection of new classics. Grab and go with favorites like Vinyl Simulator, DJFX Looper, Stopper, Lo-fi, Scatter, Phaser, and Resonator. Using BUS FX routing, selectively apply MFX or assign delay and reverb independently to any sample.\n\nThe P-6 SampleTool software for macOS and Windows is a handy companion for editing and transferring samples from your computer to the P-6. Clean up clicks with snap to zero, truncate to remove unwanted sections, normalize to standardize audio levels, and downsample for reduced sample resolution. When you’re ready, simply drag and drop the samples directly to the P-6 hardware for seamless integration and playback.\n\nThe P-6 is immensely fun as a standalone instrument but becomes even more powerful when connected to other devices. Build a portable creative ecosystem by linking with the S-1 Tweak Synth, T-8 Beat Machine, and other AIRA Compacts or gadget instruments. Take it further by streaming your entire gadget chain from the P-6 to a smartphone, tablet, or laptop over USB-C for content creation or easy integration with your favorite music software. The setup is plug-and-play, with no driver installation needed.\n\nThe P-6 is as portable as it gets, ready to record anywhere you like. Create freely with up to three hours of lithium-ion battery life per charge, supported by a rugged Roland build that assures years of enjoyment ahead.\n\nCreate infectious tracks in seconds flat with a miniature rhythm factory powered by pristine TR drums plus bass from the inimitable TB-303.\n\nPairing a powerful chord sequencer with the lavish tones of the legendary JUNO-60, this portable synth toolbox has the building blocks you need to bring harmonic substance to your jams.\n\nThis outrageously jammable effects box harmonizes, auto-pitches, vocodes, loops, and glitches your voice and anything else you feed it.\n\nDivine a new world of sonic textures with a potent micro polysynth and sound design playground inspired by the legendary SH-101.\n\nThe P-6 Creative Sampler joins the AIRA Compact gang, packing legendary Roland sampling technology into a compact, user-friendly gadget.\n\nIn this tutorial, Dustin Good explores the P-6’s powerful features and offers tips for mastering this wildly jammable instrument.\n\nLearn how the pandemic-born music organization provides “inclusive, real-world creative arts experiences\" in this exclusive conversation.Read more…\n\nLearn the origin story of vocal harmonizers and processors and explore the science behind creating vocal harmonies with music technology.Read more…\n\nThe multifaceted artist discusses his career encompassing everything from jazz-inflected percussion to art installations.Read more…\n\nJoin the 404 Day worldwide takeover with community-driven SP-powered events, showcases, workshops, and interactive demos.Read more…\n\nThe P-6 is a compact sampler capable of a wide range of sample processing and compositional techniques. Learn to use this flexible, portable instrument.Read more…\n\nGraphical editor software for the P-6 Creative Sampler.\n\nCustom case for AIRA Compact instruments.\n\nMIDI cable with right-angle 3.5mm TRS connectors, 1 ft./30 cm length. Also available in 2 ft./60 cm (BCC-2-3535) length.\n\nMIDI cable with 3.5 mm TRS and multi-directional 5-pin connectors, 1 ft./30 cm length.

      "description": "The Roland SE-02 Analog Synthesizer is a collaborative effort from Roland and Studio Electronics, that uses authentic discrete circuitry to create an analog synth with a distinctly American sound.\n\nThis video is a sounds only demonstration of the Roland SE-02 Analog Synthesizer - designed in collaboration with Studio Electronics - as part of the Roland Boutique Designer Series.\n\nThis video is an overview of the Roland SE-02 Analog Synthesizer - designed in collaboration with Studio Electronics - as part of the Roland Boutique Designer Series.\n\nThe SE-02's monophonic synthesizer engine features three voltage-controlled oscillators, a voltage-controlled 24 dB low-pass filter, and a dual gain-stage amplifier. The oscillators have six different kinds of waveforms with the warmth and complex character associated with true analog VCOs. What’s more, these VCOs are temperature stabilized with automatic tuning, so you get all the benefits and none of the downsides.\n\nThe SE-02 is big and bold, with thick, rich lows and clear, vibrant highs—exactly what you think of when you imagine classic vintage synth tone. And while the SE-02 can create astonishingly great vintage sounds, it can do so much more. It has three types of cross modulation (XMOD), a ripping filter feedback loop, a tempo-syncing LFO with nine waveforms, envelope sweeping and inverting, oscillator sync, a noise generator, and a tempo-syncing delay.\n\nWhile it’s a compact “go-anywhere” device, the knobs, switches, and buttons are sturdy and plentiful, giving you a vast palette of sound-shaping capabilities at your fingertips. Everything is hands-on and knob-per-function, with deep control and a logical, intuitive layout. To get started, you can choose from 384 expertly programmed preset sounds that cover a wide range of classic and modern tones. Tweak and modify these sounds or create something completely new, storing your own custom creations in the 128 available user locations.\n\nThe SE-02 includes a powerful 16-step sequencer to add motion and dimension to your sounds. It can sync to external tempo via MIDI, USB, or trigger input, and per-step gate time, adjustable glide, tempo, and patch number are stored with each sequence. Creative performance features allow you to set shuffle, scale, direction, and first/last steps on the fly. Even synth parameters can be automated by sequencing changes—just press a step and move a control. And despite the SE-02s compact size, the sequencer is fun and intuitive, lending itself to both studio and live usage. You can store 128 sequence patterns and construct 16 songs, each with up to 16 parts.\n\nThe SE-02 is built solidly with a rugged metal top and quality knobs and switches. And despite having a control for just about everything, it’s small enough to take just about anywhere. Due to its Roland Boutique format, it fits in our K-25m or DK-01 accessory docks, so you can add an integrated 25-key mini keyboard or have various tilt options for easy access in a variety of live and studio situations.\n\nThe SE-02 also features convenient 1/8-inch stereo jacks that reduce cable clutter, plus full-sized, standard MIDI jacks for connecting any kind of keyboard you want or controlling the SE-02 remotely. And as with other Roland Boutique synths, Chain Mode lets you increase the polyphony by connecting two or more SE-02 units together via MIDI.\n\nThere are CV inputs for both pitch and filter frequency, as well as trigger in and out, so the SE-02 works great with modular setups and other vintage gear. You can route external audio signals through the filter section, and there’s even USB audio and MIDI capabilities to seamlessly integrate with computer-based setups.\n\nStudio Electronics has been a leader in excellence and ingenuity in analog synthesizer design since 1988. Makers of the revered MidiMini, SE-1(X), ATC-1(X), Omega 8, CODE 8, Boomstar, Boomstar Modular, and Tonestar: Premium-Quality-Analog musical instruments, hand-built in the USA.\n\nThe enigmatic artist reveals how he creates his noir masterpieces and how the element of chance contributed to his runaway viral success.Read more…\n\nNew Sounds, Enhanced Features, and Computer-Based EditingRead more…\n\nThe K-25m is a 25-key, velocity sensitive keyboard designed for use with the Roland Boutique series.\n\nRoland Boutique module case with integrated tilt stand.\n\nCarrying bag for one Roland Boutique module.\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.",

        "Beyond Typical Analog\n\nThe SE-02's monophonic synthesizer engine features three voltage-controlled oscillators, a voltage-controlled 24 dB low-pass filter, and a dual gain-stage amplifier. The oscillators have six different kinds of waveforms with the warmth and complex character associated with true analog VCOs. What’s more, these VCOs are temperature stabilized with automatic tuning, so you get all the benefits and none of the downsides.\n\nThe SE-02 is big and bold, with thick, rich lows and clear, vibrant highs—exactly what you think of when you imagine classic vintage synth tone. And while the SE-02 can create astonishingly great vintage sounds, it can do so much more. It has three types of cross modulation (XMOD), a ripping filter feedback loop, a tempo-syncing LFO with nine waveforms, envelope sweeping and inverting, oscillator sync, a noise generator, and a tempo-syncing delay.\n\nWhile it’s a compact “go-anywhere” device, the knobs, switches, and buttons are sturdy and plentiful, giving you a vast palette of sound-shaping capabilities at your fingertips. Everything is hands-on and knob-per-function, with deep control and a logical, intuitive layout. To get started, you can choose from 384 expertly programmed preset sounds that cover a wide range of classic and modern tones. Tweak and modify these sounds or create something completely new, storing your own custom creations in the 128 available user locations.",
        "A More Musical Sequencer\n\nThe SE-02 includes a powerful 16-step sequencer to add motion and dimension to your sounds. It can sync to external tempo via MIDI, USB, or trigger input, and per-step gate time, adjustable glide, tempo, and patch number are stored with each sequence. Creative performance features allow you to set shuffle, scale, direction, and first/last steps on the fly. Even synth parameters can be automated by sequencing changes—just press a step and move a control. And despite the SE-02s compact size, the sequencer is fun and intuitive, lending itself to both studio and live usage. You can store 128 sequence patterns and construct 16 songs, each with up to 16 parts.",
        "Modern Flexibility\n\nThe SE-02 is built solidly with a rugged metal top and quality knobs and switches. And despite having a control for just about everything, it’s small enough to take just about anywhere. Due to its Roland Boutique format, it fits in our K-25m or DK-01 accessory docks, so you can add an integrated 25-key mini keyboard or have various tilt options for easy access in a variety of live and studio situations.\n\nThe SE-02 also features convenient 1/8-inch stereo jacks that reduce cable clutter, plus full-sized, standard MIDI jacks for connecting any kind of keyboard you want or controlling the SE-02 remotely. And as with other Roland Boutique synths, Chain Mode lets you increase the polyphony by connecting two or more SE-02 units together via MIDI.\n\nThere are CV inputs for both pitch and filter frequency, as well as trigger in and out, so the SE-02 works great with modular setups and other vintage gear. You can route external audio signals through the filter section, and there’s even USB audio and MIDI capabilities to seamlessly integrate with computer-based setups.",
        "About Studio Electronics\n\nStudio Electronics has been a leader in excellence and ingenuity in analog synthesizer design since 1988. Makers of the revered MidiMini, SE-1(X), ATC-1(X), Omega 8, CODE 8, Boomstar, Boomstar Modular, and Tonestar: Premium-Quality-Analog musical instruments, hand-built in the USA."

      "description": "In this video, Mathew Jonson breaks down his favourite new features in both the TR-08 and SH-01A and how they make a perfect performance pairing for live playing or in the studio.\n\nThis video was a one-take recording with Mathew building up the track from scratch.\n\nThe now-legendary SH-101 was a seemingly simple monophonic synthesizer launched in 1982. Unlike more complex synthesizers available at the time, the SH-101 quickly became popular for its characteristic tone and simple one-VCO → one-VCF → one-VCA → one-LFO structure. A legion of artists found it quick to program and adept at bright edgy tones and exciting sound effects. Its bass sounds are universally revered, and somehow any sound it produces always just fits perfectly in a mix.\n\nMore than thirty years later, the SH-101’s hallmark sounds continue to be sought after by electronic artists the world over. It’s a staple of vintage synth collectors and well-equipped, world-class studios, and now returns as the inspiration for the SH-01A.\n\nOriginal SH-101s are becoming increasingly rare, making them ever more expensive on the used market. Because of this, many have resorted to sample packs, hardware knockoffs, or software plug-ins loosely inspired by the SH-101. The SH-01A accurately recreates what makes the original so special, and the interface, while more compact, is 100% authentic.\n\nThe sound is vibrant and alive thanks to our proprietary Analog Circuit Behavior (ACB) technology. We use ACB to carefully recreate all the details and quirks of the original hardware by modeling each analog circuit, right down to the component level. Face-to-face consultation with the original designers and relentless research beyond the original schematics provides meticulously recreated oscillator, filter, and envelope behavior—a perfect foundation to build upon for a new generation of “101” fans.\n\nOne of the most creative features of the original SH-101 was its 100-note step sequencer. Press Load, add sequential notes with legato and rests, and press Play. Easy. Designed to inspire through simplicity, the SH-101 sequencer has been the source of countless bass lines and lead melodies on legendary dance tracks. But the limitation of playing one sequence back at a time has been resolved with the SH-01A. Now you can save and access 64 sequence patterns, perfect for any performance situation. Recall any pattern at any time, and use the iconic sequencer to control your modular rig, hardware synthesizers, and software plugins via CV/Gate, MIDI, and USB. Let the SH-01A be the heart of your electronic instrument setup, on stage or in the studio.\n\nThe SH-101 found its power in a huge monophonic voice for a wide variety of sounds. The SH-01A now has four huge voices, allowing for more modes to expand upon the original’s sound palette. On top of the classic Mono mode, you can stack the four voices in Unison mode to add some punch to your bass and lead lines. Chord mode layers any four notes, and can be shifted up and down in semi-tone intervals. Poly mode allows for four notes to be played simultaneously, making the famous monosynth now capable of pads and chords.\n\nThe simple design of the SH-101 made patch creation immediate, with sounds quickly forming under the movement of each key and slider. But that inspiring sound could vanish as quickly as it appeared due to its lack of patch memory. The SH-01A adds 64 writeable patches that can serve as presets for different tracks or quick starting points for experimenting with new sound designs, making inspiration only a button press away.\n\nThe SH-01A takes the original SH-101’s portability and stage prowess to a whole new level. It’s small enough to take just about anywhere, yet ruggedly built with sturdy knobs, metal-shaft sliders, and solid silver buttons like the original. It has several tilt options for easy viewing in various live and studio scenarios, and can serve as a low-latency, portable audio interface. In addition, it has a built-in speaker, and even runs on batteries. And when mounted in the optional K-25m Keyboard Unit, it can be used as a compact, all-in-one synth with 25 velocity-sensitive keys. With all this power and flexibility, you may be most surprised by the SH-01A’s affordable price, which puts the iconic SH-101 mojo within reach of just about anyone.\n\nThe enigmatic artist reveals how he creates his noir masterpieces and how the element of chance contributed to his runaway viral success.Read more…\n\nRobin “Scanner” Rimbaud explores many genres—from avant-garde to accessible.

        "Beauty Through Simplicity\n\nThe now-legendary SH-101 was a seemingly simple monophonic synthesizer launched in 1982. Unlike more complex synthesizers available at the time, the SH-101 quickly became popular for its characteristic tone and simple one-VCO → one-VCF → one-VCA → one-LFO structure. A legion of artists found it quick to program and adept at bright edgy tones and exciting sound effects. Its bass sounds are universally revered, and somehow any sound it produces always just fits perfectly in a mix.\n\nMore than thirty years later, the SH-101’s hallmark sounds continue to be sought after by electronic artists the world over. It’s a staple of vintage synth collectors and well-equipped, world-class studios, and now returns as the inspiration for the SH-01A.",
        "A is for Authentic\n\nOriginal SH-101s are becoming increasingly rare, making them ever more expensive on the used market. Because of this, many have resorted to sample packs, hardware knockoffs, or software plug-ins loosely inspired by the SH-101. The SH-01A accurately recreates what makes the original so special, and the interface, while more compact, is 100% authentic.\n\nThe sound is vibrant and alive thanks to our proprietary Analog Circuit Behavior (ACB) technology. We use ACB to carefully recreate all the details and quirks of the original hardware by modeling each analog circuit, right down to the component level. Face-to-face consultation with the original designers and relentless research beyond the original schematics provides meticulously recreated oscillator, filter, and envelope behavior—a perfect foundation to build upon for a new generation of “101” fans.",
        "An Inspired, Iconic Sequencer Revisited\n\nOne of the most creative features of the original SH-101 was its 100-note step sequencer. Press Load, add sequential notes with legato and rests, and press Play. Easy. Designed to inspire through simplicity, the SH-101 sequencer has been the source of countless bass lines and lead melodies on legendary dance tracks. But the limitation of playing one sequence back at a time has been resolved with the SH-01A. Now you can save and access 64 sequence patterns, perfect for any performance situation. Recall any pattern at any time, and use the iconic sequencer to control your modular rig, hardware synthesizers, and software plugins via CV/Gate, MIDI, and USB. Let the SH-01A be the heart of your electronic instrument setup, on stage or in the studio.",
        "Did You Say Polyphonic?\n\nThe SH-101 found its power in a huge monophonic voice for a wide variety of sounds. The SH-01A now has four huge voices, allowing for more modes to expand upon the original’s sound palette. On top of the classic Mono mode, you can stack the four voices in Unison mode to add some punch to your bass and lead lines. Chord mode layers any four notes, and can be shifted up and down in semi-tone intervals. Poly mode allows for four notes to be played simultaneously, making the famous monosynth now capable of pads and chords.",
        "Portable. Performer.\n\nThe simple design of the SH-101 made patch creation immediate, with sounds quickly forming under the movement of each key and slider. But that inspiring sound could vanish as quickly as it appeared due to its lack of patch memory. The SH-01A adds 64 writeable patches that can serve as presets for different tracks or quick starting points for experimenting with new sound designs, making inspiration only a button press away.\n\nThe SH-01A takes the original SH-101’s portability and stage prowess to a whole new level. It’s small enough to take just about anywhere, yet ruggedly built with sturdy knobs, metal-shaft sliders, and solid silver buttons like the original. It has several tilt options for easy viewing in various live and studio scenarios, and can serve as a low-latency, portable audio interface. In addition, it has a built-in speaker, and even runs on batteries. And when mounted in the optional K-25m Keyboard Unit, it can be used as a compact, all-in-one synth with 25 velocity-sensitive keys. With all this power and flexibility, you may be most surprised by the SH-01A’s affordable price, which puts the iconic SH-101 mojo within reach of just about anyone."

      "description": "The SYSTEM-8 is a direct result of over four decades of synthesizer development at Roland, including some of the most iconic instruments ever made. It absolutely nails the sound and behavior of our most sought-after classics, like the included JUPITER-8, JUNO-106 and JX-3P synthesizers—and yet it does so much more. Mix and match modern and vintage oscillators and filter types with multiple dedicated effects—then split and layer them into never-before-heard new sounds. Shape every detail with the huge array of high-resolution controls and create fully realized musical ideas with the onboard polyphonic sequencer with motion recording.\n\nThe SYSTEM-8’s synth architecture draws on our deep history of research and development—and it includes authentic models of classic oscillators, filters and effects. It even has down-to-the-circuit recreations of the JUPITER-8, JUNO-106 and JX-3P built-in, not to mention the world of legendary synths available on Roland Cloud. But the SYSTEM-8 goes way beyond vintage. It has multiple flavors of digital and analog-style oscillators including Saw, Square, Triangle, SuperSaw, FM and more completely unique waveforms. Filter options include the famous JUPITER and JUNO filters as well as more recent designs like the unique Side Band Filter. Ever wondered what a knobby, FM synth with a JUPITER-8 filter would be like? Now you can find out. Able to split, layer and combine different synth engines, the SYSTEM-8 is unparalleled in its versatility, going from glass to growl, or pluck to punch, with just a few tweaks of its high-resolution controls.\n\nThe SYSTEM-8 features three expansion slots for hosting and controlling PLUG-OUT synths, which are complete, 100-percent authentic models of Roland classics that you can swap in and out whenever you like. JUPITER-8, JUNO-106, and JX-3P PLUG-OUTs are included, and it’s possible to combine the native synth engine and any hosted PLUG-OUTs to create super-synth patches with layered voices and custom splits. The growing PLUG-OUT instrument collection on Roland Cloud includes the JUNO-60, SH-2, SH-101, PROMARS, SYSTEM-100, and many others, and they also work as DAW plug-ins that you can control from the SYSTEM-8’s panel.\n\nWith one of the most expansive control layouts available, the SYSTEM-8 has dozens of knobs, sliders, and buttons for you to shape your sound. Dimmable lights give you feedback as to which controls are active and let you see what’s happening in dim studios and dark stages. Controls have a logical, flowing, layout with tonal tweaking in mind. You’ll get ultra-smooth parameter changes that sound great and help you find the sweet spots.\n\nThe SYSTEM-8’s polyphonic sequencer is designed to be quick and flowing, keeping up with the rapid pace of your musical ideas. The upper and lower layers of the SYSTEM-8 each have their own dedicated sequencer which can trigger internal sounds or devices connected via USB, standard MIDI, or CV/GATE. You can record in step or real-time modes and the sequencer can even capture per-step or real-time parameter changes using motion recording. Keep things fresh and exciting with dedicated knobs for scale, gate, and shuffle as well as hands-on control of playback modes and direction.\n\nWith extensive support for audio and MIDI over USB, the SYSTEM-8 integrates perfectly into your studio setup or live rig. It functions as a high-resolution audio interface making live performance and on-the-road production setups clean and simple. The 49-full size keys are responsive, and the huge array of lighted knobs and sliders mean you can control your favorite plugin instruments with an interface made for tweaking synthesizers, instead of rows of generic controls. Many Roland Cloud synths even have modes that mimic the SYSTEM-8’s layout so you get automatic and intuitive one-to-one control.\n\nIn addition to its full complement of MIDI and USB connections, the SYSTEM-8 also has built-in CV/GATE outputs, meaning it works as well with analog and modular gear as it does with software plugins. In fact, it’s the ideal centerpiece to the wide world of Eurorack modules and hybrid setups. You can use the high-quality 49-key keyboard to play your modular synths or use the advanced sequencer to send note and pitch data to external gear in perfect sync.\n\nPowerful and deep, the SYSTEM-8 delivers a vast palette of sounds inspired by over four decades of legendary Roland synths.\n\nJUNO-106 PLUG-OUT Sound Preview\n\nThis video introduces the JUNO-106 PLUG-OUT for the Roland SYSTEM-8 Synthesizer.

      "description": "The TR-06 is a detailed replica of the classic Roland TR-606—with some major modern upgrades. Our new Roland Boutique version has the distinctive tone and iconic look of the original, with more sound-shaping options, innovative sequencing capabilities, and an array of triggers for driving modular gear.\n\nReleased in 1981 as a companion to the TB-303 Bass Line, the TR-606 was a programmable drum machine whose size, price, and ease of use made at-home music production more accessible to everyone. The punchy midrange kicks, popping toms, and sizzling hi-hats were a hit with DIY musicians, appearing across genres from '80s new wave and punk to all types of electronic styles.\n\nThe sound of the 606 is unique in the TR family and the backbone of numerous classic and underground tracks. But while many love its distinctive tone, it wasn't especially versatile. The TR-06 reimagines the original with new sound-crafting potential and plush onboard effects. Control tuning, decay, and pan for each instrument, or crank up the internal gain, pushing the circuit model into warm overdrive or aggressive distortion. The onboard compressor adds warmth and punch, while the tempo delay creates depth and space from subtle repeats to controlled chaos.\n\nLike the original, the step sequencer in the TR-06 is familiar and straightforward, so you can bang out any type of beat quickly and easily. And now it's been updated with advanced features like adjustable sub-steps for ratcheted parts, step-loop for instant pattern slicing, and per-step probability for beats that never get boring.\n\nMany modular and tabletop rigs are missing a good drum sequencer that's convenient and easy to use. The TR-06 has five trigger outs and a trigger in, so it's easy to interface with other gear, sparking new ideas and creative possibilities. Sequencing is fast and fluid, and you can mix and layer your external modules with the TR-06's internal sounds for massive rhythmic sequences.\n\nLike other Roland Boutiques, the TR-06 is sturdy and well-constructed with a solid metal top and a color-matched case with three tilt options. It's a high-quality USB audio interface for quick and easy recording with your computer and can run on standard AA batteries for hours of uninhibited jamming. It even has a built-in speaker, because you never know what life might throw your way.\n\nPair the TR-06 with the TR-606 Software Rhythm Composer available on Roland Cloud and enjoy the benefits of easy hardware and software integration. The TR-606 plug-in has expanded sequencing capabilities, and the TR-06's knobs are pre-mapped for intuitive, hands-on workflow.\n\nDrummer, DJ, and electronic visionary Rusty Egan helped shape Britain's New Romantic pulse—from Visage's \"Fade to Grey\" to the Blitz Club.Read more…\n\nThe enigmatic artist reveals how he creates his noir masterpieces and how the element of chance contributed to his runaway viral success.Read more…\n\nDig deep into what's possible with triggers inputs and learn to create evolving sequences that become more than the sum of their parts.Read more…\n\nTriggers offer a wide range of possibilities for interfacing drum machines with other gear. Explore the best ways to get started using them.Read more…\n\nLearn how to create unpredictable dynamic shifts in your electronic soundscapes when using a Eurorack rig.Read more…\n\nLearn to utilize your drum machine's trigger inputs and outputs to connect with Eurorack modular gear systems.Read more…\n\nRoland Boutique is a world of instruments that inspire electronic music creativity by expanding on the legendary sounds of the past with a workflow to suit the modern producer and musician.Read more…\n\nRoland Boutique module case with integrated tilt stand.\n\nCarrying bag for one Roland Boutique module.\n\nCompatible with Apple Mac series (Intel-based).\nCompatible with Apple Silicon Mac (using the M1 chip).\n\nIf you have questions about operating your Roland product, please check our Knowledge Base for answers to the most common questions.\nYou can also contact our Product Support through Roland Backstage.\nIn addition, we have a library of Owner’s Manuals and Support Documents that you can download and reference.\n\nCompatible with Apple Mac series (Intel-based).\nCompatible with Apple Silicon Mac (using the M1 chip).",

      "description": "In this video, we chat about the latest instrument in the Roland Boutique series - the Roland TR-08 Rhythm Composer.\n\nIn this video, Mathew Jonson breaks down his favourite new features in both the TR-08 and SH-01A and how they make a perfect performance pairing for live playing or in the studio.\n\nThis video was a one-take recording with Mathew building up the track from scratch.\n\nThe TR-808 arrived in 1980 to an unsuspecting and somewhat bewildered public. To many at the time, its purely analog sound and range of tweakable parameters didn’t exactly deliver “traditional” drum sounds. It wasn’t until adventurous musicians and producers got their hands on the TR-808 and started tweaking those knobs that the world would fully realize the sonic impact it would leave on music forever. For the next three decades, the sizzling hi-hats and snappy snare, the robotic, clicky rim shot, the unmistakable cowbell, and yes, that booming bass drum, would be heard on many thousands of tracks. Worldwide hits, underground classic, and entire genres were spawned. Its influence is so deep that it’s been name-dropped in famous tracks, had albums dedicated to it and bands named after it, and even been the subject of a feature-length documentary film.\n\nTime has not diminished the TR-808’s influence. New genres continue to make use of the 808, with some utilizing it as the main instrument and defining sound of the style. Sure, you can use samples of a TR-808, but there’s nothing quite like the real thing. The 808’s user interface with its buttons, knobs, and switches, and the odd quirks of how the sounds interact with each other—they’re all vitally important to conjuring up that real 808 mojo. And you know it when you hear it.\n\nThe new TR-08 adds some thoughtful and modern touches to the classic formula. The sequencer has 16 sub-steps per step, so you can create detailed snare fills and intricate, rolling hi-hats. It also has a track-selectable trigger out for working with other instruments like the TB-03, SH-01A, or modular gear. An unobtrusive LED display provides finer control of tempo and shuffle. You can step-program or tap in your parts in real-time without stopping to change modes. Everything sends and receives MIDI control messages and it even supports audio and MIDI over USB.\n\nOriginal TR-808s are big and heavy, and their rarity makes them extremely expensive and sought-after on the used market. Because of this, many have resorted to 808 sample packs or hardware knockoffs. But there’s something about the colors and controls and, of course, the sound of a genuine TR-808 that brings home the sound of so many classic tracks. The TR-08 accurately recreates the ingredients that make an 808 so special. The interface, while miniaturized, is 100% authentic. The sound is vibrant and alive thanks to our proprietary Analog Circuit Behavior (ACB) technology. We use ACB to carefully recreate all the details and quirks of the original hardware by modeling each analog circuit, right down to the component level.\n\nNot only does the TR-08 look and sound the part, but it also has some modern features and conveniences. With all this beat-making power, it would be a shame to keep it shackled to the studio. After all, inspiration can strike anywhere, and drum machines are fun to play live. The TR-08 is literally small enough to take just about anywhere. It’s ruggedly built with sturdy knobs, buttons, and switches. It has several tilt options for easy viewing in various live and studio scenarios. It can be a low-latency, portable audio interface. It has a built-in speaker, and even runs on batteries for when the beat absolutely must go on. With all this power and flexibility, you may be most surprised by the TR-08’s affordable price, which puts the legendary 808 vibe within reach of just about anyone who’s ever dreamed of owning the iconic original.\n\nDrummer, DJ, and electronic visionary Rusty Egan helped shape Britain's New Romantic pulse—from Visage's \"Fade to Grey\" to the Blitz Club.Read more…\n\nFor these Edmonton synth provocateurs, punk is more than a genre.

        "The Boom in the Room\n\nThe TR-808 arrived in 1980 to an unsuspecting and somewhat bewildered public. To many at the time, its purely analog sound and range of tweakable parameters didn’t exactly deliver “traditional” drum sounds. It wasn’t until adventurous musicians and producers got their hands on the TR-808 and started tweaking those knobs that the world would fully realize the sonic impact it would leave on music forever. For the next three decades, the sizzling hi-hats and snappy snare, the robotic, clicky rim shot, the unmistakable cowbell, and yes, that booming bass drum, would be heard on many thousands of tracks. Worldwide hits, underground classic, and entire genres were spawned. Its influence is so deep that it’s been name-dropped in famous tracks, had albums dedicated to it and bands named after it, and even been the subject of a feature-length documentary film.",
        "A New Generation of 808\n\nTime has not diminished the TR-808’s influence. New genres continue to make use of the 808, with some utilizing it as the main instrument and defining sound of the style. Sure, you can use samples of a TR-808, but there’s nothing quite like the real thing. The 808’s user interface with its buttons, knobs, and switches, and the odd quirks of how the sounds interact with each other—they’re all vitally important to conjuring up that real 808 mojo. And you know it when you hear it.\n\nThe new TR-08 adds some thoughtful and modern touches to the classic formula. The sequencer has 16 sub-steps per step, so you can create detailed snare fills and intricate, rolling hi-hats. It also has a track-selectable trigger out for working with other instruments like the TB-03, SH-01A, or modular gear. An unobtrusive LED display provides finer control of tempo and shuffle. You can step-program or tap in your parts in real-time without stopping to change modes. Everything sends and receives MIDI control messages and it even supports audio and MIDI over USB.",
        "Portable. Affordable. Authentic.\n\nOriginal TR-808s are big and heavy, and their rarity makes them extremely expensive and sought-after on the used market. Because of this, many have resorted to 808 sample packs or hardware knockoffs. But there’s something about the colors and controls and, of course, the sound of a genuine TR-808 that brings home the sound of so many classic tracks. The TR-08 accurately recreates the ingredients that make an 808 so special. The interface, while miniaturized, is 100% authentic. The sound is vibrant and alive thanks to our proprietary Analog Circuit Behavior (ACB) technology. We use ACB to carefully recreate all the details and quirks of the original hardware by modeling each analog circuit, right down to the component level.\n\nNot only does the TR-08 look and sound the part, but it also has some modern features and conveniences. With all this beat-making power, it would be a shame to keep it shackled to the studio. After all, inspiration can strike anywhere, and drum machines are fun to play live. The TR-08 is literally small enough to take just about anywhere. It’s ruggedly built with sturdy knobs, buttons, and switches. It has several tilt options for easy viewing in various live and studio scenarios. It can be a low-latency, portable audio interface. It has a built-in speaker, and even runs on batteries for when the beat absolutely must go on. With all this power and flexibility, you may be most surprised by the TR-08’s affordable price, which puts the legendary 808 vibe within reach of just about anyone who’s ever dreamed of owning the iconic original."
