      "description": "The latest in our long line of professional MIDI controllers, the Roland A-88MKII is supremely playable, with onboard creative tools for today's musicians and producers. Our acclaimed hammer-action keyboard and built-to-last quality combine with modern features like USB-C connectivity, RGB-lit controls, and MIDI 2.0 support for the best performance in its class.\n\nWhen it comes to MIDI controllers, playability often seems like an afterthought. With the A-88MKII, we bring our acclaimed keyboard feel, enjoyed by professional players on stages around the world, to your studio. Its robust wood construction creates a solid playing experience you can feel under your fingers. And you can easily adjust the sensitivity and responsiveness to match your unique playing style.\n\nThe A-88MKII has three user-definable zones, so you can layer and split the keyboard with different sounds or instruments. Our unique pitch/mod lever and an array of RGB-lit knobs and pads give you expressive, hands-on control of your sound. And a sustain pedal input plus two fully assignable pedal inputs mean your feet can get in on the action too.\n\nToday's musical styles demand special production techniques. And some soft synths and modules don't always have the onboard tools you might like. The A-88MKII extends your creative arsenal with three configurable zones, advanced arpeggiator, chord memory, and multipurpose pads that can trigger commands and events, and energize real-time performance.\n\nThe A-88MKII includes the latest technologies for years of universal compatibility and convenience. Class-compliant USB-C enables bus power and single-cable connectivity with devices running Windows, macOS, iOS, and iPadOS.* The latest A-88MKII system software (Version 2.0 and later) provides support for MIDI 2.0, unlocking advanced real-time expressive capabilities with the keyboard and panel knobs.\n\n*An appropriate Apple USB-C adaptor is required to connect the A-88MKII to an iPhone or iPad equipped with the Lightning interface. Bus power is not supported with this connection, so the A-88MKII must be powered with the optional PSB-1U AC power adaptor.\n\nCustomize the A-88MKII with the control app for macOS and Windows. See all your layers and control mappings at a glance and assign commands to the pads with custom colors for visual feedback. You can create custom setups to control specific soft synths or external hardware and instantly recall everything with the handy Snap Shot function.\n\nSpace is always at a premium in today's personal studios. The A-88MKII is designed to be as thin and shallow as possible while still retaining the smooth, dynamic playability that Roland instruments are known for. Surfaces are flat and edges are squared so they sit neat and flush against other gear or when integrated into a studio desk.\n\nThe prolific player shares her thoughts on touring with RAYE, finding success in the music industry, and her Roland gear.Read more\u2026\n\nVersatile table-style stand for keyboard instruments.\n\nHeavy-duty adjustable Z-stand for stage pianos and other keyboards.\n\nSemi-rigid keyboard case with integrated wheels for 88-note instruments.\n\nVersatile carrying bag for portable 88-note keyboards.\n\nMIDI cable, 3 ft./1 m length. Also available in 5 ft./1.5 m (RMIDI-B5), 10 ft./3 m (RMIDI-B10), 15 ft./4.5 m (RMIDI-B15), and 20 ft./6 m (RMIDI-B20) lengths.\n\nThree grand piano pedals in one convenient, clutter-free unit.\n\nDurable expression pedal for use with keyboards or other Expression-compatible instruments to control a range of functions and effects parameters.\n\nA controller that plays like an instrument.\n\nDeep expression.\n\nCreative control.\n\nMIDI 2.0 and USB-C\n\nCustom control. Instant recall.\n\nWhen less is more.",

      "description": "Take online gaming sound to the next level with BRIDGE CAST, your all-in-one solution for premium livestream audio. This customizable desktop hub is packed with secret weapons to take out the competition, including dual sound mixes, vocal transformer effects, music playback, sound effects, and support for a broadcast-grade mic and headphones. In the heat of the battle, BRIDGE CAST ensures that your audio is always as epic as your gameplay.\n\nThe companion BRIDGE CAST app takes your experience even further, allowing you to customize BRIDGE CAST audio features and enhance streams with royalty-free background music tracks and sound effects via BGM CAST and Roland Cloud.\n\nLearn how BRIDGE CAST's powerful audio tools will elevate your gaming streams with professional sound quality and easy real-time mixing control.\n\nBRIDGE CAST gives you what you need to deliver outstanding sound in every session, coupled with killer sonic tools to help you stand out from the crowd. Roland has been a leading innovator in electronic music and audio/video gear for over 50 years. With BRIDGE CAST on your desktop, you\u2019ll be driving your sound with the brand trusted by generations of top creators worldwide.\n\nConnect BRIDGE CAST to your gaming computer via USB-C.\n\nPlug in a professional microphone to the XLR input.\n\nHook up your headphones.\n\nCustomize the audio and panel functions with the companion app.\n\nSet up personal and stream mixes with the hands-on controls.\n\nBRIDGE CAST lets you chat and interact using a broadcast-grade dynamic or condenser microphone, the foundation of any professional audio setup. The high-performance XLR mic preamp delivers clear, dynamic sound in the box, with no need for messy external add-ons. You get superior audio monitoring too, with a powerful headphone amplifier and high-sensitivity output for pro-quality phones. The versatile headphones connector also supports a headset mic for a quick, single-cable connection.\n\nWith the dual audio mixer in BRIDGE CAST, you can independently balance the mic level, team chats, gameplay sounds, and background music for you and your viewers. Give yourself a winning advantage with a personal mix that prioritizes what you need to hear while gaming. Then create a separate stream mix that\u2019s perfectly balanced for maximum online engagement.\n\nAlong with a headphones output, BRIDGE CAST has a line output for external gaming speakers. Level knobs for each output let you easily control volumes and smoothly transition between phones and speakers during gameplay. There\u2019s also a dedicated streaming level control to dial in the sound for your online audience.\n\nMorph your voice and become your character with fun processing derived from Roland\u2019s famous VT voice transformer products. Adjust the pitch and formant to change your age or gender. Or go even further and take on the persona of a beast or alien.\n\nBRIDGE CAST also includes EQ, compression, and other pro vocal processing to level up your streams. A low-cut filter softens pesky \u201cP\u201d and \u201cT\u201d plosives, while the de-esser cleans up harsh \u201cS\u201d tones. There\u2019s a noise suppressor to throttle background distractions, plus reverb to launch your voice into another dimension. And with the muscular hardware DSP handling the audio load, all your computer power is dedicated to gaming and streaming.\n\nImmerse yourself in 5.1 or 7.1 virtual surround sound for headphones and stereo speaker systems, powered by advanced Roland technology. Audio is converted from a PC to virtual surround sound via a USB connection, delivering a powerful and engaging sound experience.\n\nSlay your competition by highlighting important game sounds with Game EQ presets. Pinpoint audio frequencies and boost their levels to make it easier to hear critical elements, like enemy footsteps in first-person shooter games. You can even fine-tune while visually monitoring the analyzed waveform in real time. Once you find the ideal settings for different game titles, save them in onboard profiles and call them up with quick button presses while playing.\n\nBuilding your brand is an essential part of creating an online following. Choose your core BRIDGE CAST look with bold Black and Ice White finish options. And take it to another level by customizing the detachable faceplate using our downloadable skin template, which allows you to personalize the panel with your team or gamertag design. It\u2019s also possible to customize the LED colors of the four control knobs for additional flair.\n\nThe ergonomic BRIDGE CAST panel lets you easily control your mix while staying focused on the game. Everything you need is at your fingers, including grab-and-go level knobs and assignable buttons for muting sounds and accessing various functions. The rock-solid design won\u2019t move around on your desktop, and the discrete rear-panel connections keep clutter in check.\n\nThe powerful BRIDGE CAST app works in tandem with the hardware, giving you full access to an array of in-depth features. Dial in mic and audio parameters, configure Game EQ presets, and more. You can also re-assign hardware controls for your needs and save/recall custom BRIDGE CAST configurations for different games and streaming audiences.\n\nUsing the BRIDGE CAST app, effortlessly tailor your sound with intuitive microphone settings for speed and precision. The version 5.00 update allows you to adjust EQ with quick-access controls and use the studio-grade compressor to achieve a clean, professional vocal sound with a single fader. There's also an expander that minimizes unwanted background noise without unnatural artifacts.\n\nWith BGM CAST, adding background music and sonic color to streams has never been easier. Available through the BRIDGE CAST app and Roland Cloud, BGM CAST puts a growing selection of royalty-free background music and sound effects at your fingertips. Choose music by mood and genre or create playlists of your favorites for stress-free music management. You can also assign sound effects to the four hardware buttons for instant triggering.\n\nA free Roland Account provides 36 background music tracks and 16 sound effects to use at no charge. Signing up for Roland Cloud Core membership through the BRIDGE CAST app unlocks thousands of additional music tracks and hundreds of sound effects, with new selections added each month. Membership also includes powerful tools for modern music creators, including the ZENOLOGY synthesizer, Zenbeats production software, Sound Packs, and more.\n\nGet the BRIDGE CAST App\n\nIf you need a unified audio and video solution, be sure to check out BRIDGE CAST X.

      "description": "The CB-404 is the official carrying case for the Roland SP-404MKII and previous models in the iconic SP-404 portable sampler series. Streamlined and rugged, it features a semi-rigid EVA shell with a tough polyester exterior and a moveable internal partition that creates separate compartments for the sampler and items such as an AC adaptor. There\u2019s also a detachable pouch for small items, plus a shoulder strap with a wide adjustment range. As a bonus, we\u2019ve also included four orange knobs for customizing the look of the SP-404MKII model.\n\nRoland SP samplers are the bona fide kings of performance-based beatmaking, celebrated for their distinctive sound and ability to create rapid-fire beats anywhere. With the CB-404, you can be sure your SP instrument is well protected no matter where you travel.\n\nThe CB-404\u2019s semi-rigid EVA exterior provides durable protection with reduced weight. An internal partition is secured with hook-and-loop attachments, allowing you to adjust the compartment sizes for different SP-404 models and various accessories. A detachable pouch is fitted into the lid for stowing other small items and features a soft fabric material to protect the sampler\u2019s faceplate.\n\nThe CB-404 includes a tough shoulder strap with a wide adjustment range for different traveling styles. And when you want to carry the case by hand or stow it in a larger bag, simply remove the strap with the easy-to-detach clips.\n\nMany creators like to personalize the knobs and faceplate on the SP-404MKII to match their mood or style. The CB-404 comes with a set of four knobs in classic orange, allowing you to change up the look of your sampler in seconds.\n\nNote: The included knob set only works with the SP-404MKII model and is not available separately.\n\nCreate with Confidence\n\nLight and Rugged\n\nVersatile Strap Design\n\nCustom Knobs",

      "description": "Do you have a passion for music? GO:KEYS 3 makes it easy to go from being a fan to an active music creator. This fun modern keyboard unlocks a simple new approach to making music, encouraging you to explore sounds and ideas in the moment\u2014no previous experience required. Just power on, push a few buttons, and let your imagination flow. And as your skills develop, deeper features allow you to travel as far as your ambition takes you.\n\nWith GO:KEYS 3 under your fingers, you have everything you need to turn your musical dreams into reality.\n\nLearning music doesn\u2019t have to be hard. GO:KEYS 3 invites exploration at every turn, urging your inner creative voice to emerge. The friendly, interactive interface stimulates discovery and spontaneous musical moments, even if you\u2019ve never played an instrument before.\n\nAs many top composers will tell you, playing one note with an inspiring sound is often all it takes to spark a complete idea. GO:KEYS 3 includes over 1000 sounds from Roland\u2019s historic library, which has motivated top music artists in every genre for over 50 years. Journey through a universe of possibilities with the expressive 61-note keyboard, from acoustic pianos and orchestral instruments to modern synthesizers, guitars, drums, and beyond.\n\nOnce you find a sound that energizes you, experiment by creating melodies and arpeggios over automatic musical backing. GO:KEYS 3 is filled with ready-made chord progressions in various styles, all with the immersive sound of a finished record. It\u2019s also possible to craft your own chord sequences, and you can easily find the progressions for your favorite songs online or with dedicated apps.\n\nAs a chord progression loops, discover your own performance style by remixing sounds. Change things up with four variations. Drop parts in and out, including the drums, bass, and backing chords. Swap instruments for a different vibe. And create dynamic energy by processing the entire sound with filtering, lo-fi tones, beat slicing, and other ear-catching performance effects.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve mastered chord progressions, go even further by directing a band of virtual musicians. GO:KEYS 3 offers a wide selection of dynamic accompaniments controlled by one or two left-hand fingers. Jam melodies and solos with your right hand as the band backs every move. Then weave in more sophisticated textures with full left-hand chords as your technique grows.\n\nAt any time, you can instantly capture what you\u2019re doing with GO:KEYS 3 and listen back. Analyze and hone your ideas. Show off your progress with family and friends. Or share your skills with the world on social media.\n\nWith its portable, all-in-one design, you can pick up GO:KEYS 3 and enjoy music anywhere in your living space. The built-in stereo sound system delivers rich, satisfying sound, while support for AA battery power makes setup fast and easy. And when you want to play privately, plug in headphones or earbuds to enjoy GO:KEYS 3 without disturbing others.\n\nListening to your favorite music is a great way to inspire the next creative session. Play songs from your music library via Bluetooth or USB memory and jam along. Then, use the center cancel function to remove the vocals and sing them yourself.

      "description": "Do you have a passion for music? GO:KEYS 5 makes it easy to go from being a fan to an active music creator. This fun modern keyboard unlocks a simple new approach to making music, encouraging you to explore sounds and ideas in the moment\u2014no previous experience required. Just power on, push a few buttons, and let your imagination flow. And as your skills develop, deeper features allow you to travel as far as your ambition takes you.\n\nWith GO:KEYS 5 under your fingers, you have everything you need to turn your musical dreams into reality.\n\nLearning music doesn\u2019t have to be hard. GO:KEYS 5 invites exploration at every turn, urging your inner creative voice to emerge. The friendly, interactive interface stimulates discovery and spontaneous musical moments, even if you\u2019ve never played an instrument before.\n\nAs many top composers will tell you, playing one note with an inspiring sound is often all it takes to spark a complete idea. GO:KEYS 5 includes over 1000 sounds from Roland\u2019s historic library, which has motivated top music artists in every genre for over 50 years. Journey through a universe of possibilities with the expressive 61-note keyboard, from acoustic pianos and orchestral instruments to modern synthesizers, guitars, drums, and beyond.\n\nOnce you find a sound that energizes you, experiment by creating melodies and arpeggios over automatic musical backing. GO:KEYS 5 is filled with ready-made chord progressions in various styles, all with the immersive sound of a finished record. It\u2019s also possible to craft your own chord sequences, and you can easily find the progressions for your favorite songs online or with dedicated apps.\n\nAs a chord progression loops, discover your own performance style by remixing sounds. Change things up with four variations. Drop parts in and out, including the drums, bass, and backing chords. Swap instruments for a different vibe. And create dynamic energy by processing the entire sound with filtering, lo-fi tones, beat slicing, and other ear-catching performance effects.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve mastered chord progressions, go even further by directing a band of virtual musicians. GO:KEYS 5 offers a wide selection of dynamic accompaniments controlled by one or two left-hand fingers. Jam melodies and solos with your right hand as the band backs every move. Then weave in more sophisticated textures with full left-hand chords as your technique grows.\n\nGO:KEYS 5 also features a microphone input and a large selection of effects to enhance your voice. Sing along with your compositions, complete with studio-style reverb for a polished sound. Magically create real-time harmonies that automatically follow your chords and accompaniment. Or transform your voice with robotic tones that mimic the electronic sounds heard on current pop hits.\n\nAt any time, you can instantly capture what you\u2019re doing with GO:KEYS 5 and listen back. Analyze and hone your ideas. Show off your progress with family and friends. Or share your skills with the world on social media.\n\nWith its portable, all-in-one design, you can pick up GO:KEYS 5 and enjoy music anywhere in your living space. The built-in stereo sound system and passive radiator deliver big sound and powerful bass response, while support for AA battery power makes setup fast and easy. And when you want to play privately, plug in headphones or earbuds to enjoy GO:KEYS 5 without disturbing others.\n\nListening to your favorite music is a great way to inspire the next creative session. Play songs from your music library via Bluetooth, USB memory, or the analog audio inputs and jam along. Then, use the center cancel function to remove the vocals and sing them yourself. GO:KEYS 5 also supports Bluetooth MIDI and audio/MIDI over USB, opening the door to further creative possibilities with music apps on a computer or mobile device.\n\nWant more inspiration? On Roland Cloud, there\u2019s an ever-growing selection of premium sounds and exciting new arranger styles to explore. GO:KEYS 5 also supports Roland Cloud Connect, an optional wireless adapter that lets you browse, audition, and download Roland Cloud content from your smartphone.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to take the next step in your musical journey, Melodics Essentials for Roland is the perfect partner to extend the GO:KEYS experience.

      "description": "NOTICE: Beginning November 1, 2024, some Alexa functions are no longer supported with this product.\n\nThis product has provided Alexa-based services through the GO:PIANO Alexa Setup App. However, it has become difficult to maintain stable services in the future, so we have decided to end support for the app. As a result, some Alexa functions detailed on this product page will no longer be available. Other Alexa functions may continue to be available, but operation is not guaranteed. All instrument functions that don\u2019t require Alexa remain operational.\n\nIf you own GO:PIANO with Alexa Built-in and have inquiries regarding this matter, please visit Roland Backstage.\n\n\nGO:PIANO with Alexa Built-in introduces a smart new approach to playing and learning the piano, making the experience easier and more engaging than ever before. This fun portable instrument can be played anywhere around your home and sounds amazing thanks to Roland\u2019s acclaimed piano sound engine. Better still, you can operate nearly every onboard control using just your voice!\n\nWhen playing GO:PIANO with Alexa Built-in, you never have to interrupt the musical flow with fussy button presses or complicated menus. Want to turn on the metronome or choose a different sound? Just ask Alexa! It\u2019s even possible to record your performances and upload them to free cloud storage for playback later. And when you want to play along with your favorite songs, just ask Alexa to queue them up from Amazon Music.\n\nSome Alexa functions detailed above are no longer available due to the discontinuation of support for the GO:PIANO Alexa Setup App.\n\nThis product is not available in all regions. Amazon, Alexa, and all related logos are trademarks of Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.\n\nGO:PIANO with Alexa Built-in makes complicated panel operations a thing of the past. Using just your voice, you can instantly call up any of the 40 onboard sounds, and you never have to take your hands off the keyboard. Many other settings can also be adjusted while staying in the flow, like turning the metronome on/off, changing up the beat, and more.\n\nNOTICE: The voice command functions detailed above are no longer available due to the discontinuation of support for the GO:PIANO Alexa Setup App.\n\nSince it also works as an Alexa-enabled device, GO:PIANO with Alexa Built-in allows you to listen and play along to songs from Amazon Music* through the keyboard\u2019s high-quality sound system. With a huge variety of songs available, you\u2019ll never run out of inspiration for daily music adventures.\n\n*Requires a subscription to Prime Music or Amazon Music Unlimited. Visit the Amazon website for details.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve mastered a piece or composed a new idea, just ask Alexa to record your performance. You can then listen back and evaluate what you\u2019ve done. It\u2019s even possible to upload your recordings to free cloud storage, where they\u2019re always accessible for playback when GO:PIANO with Alexa Built-in is connected via Wi-Fi.\n\nNOTICE: The cloud storage functions detailed above are no longer available due to the discontinuation of support for the GO:PIANO Alexa Setup App.\n\nWith the combined technologies in GO:PIANO with Alexa Built-in, you can fast-track learning like never before. Alexa sharpens your music sensibilities with ear training and builds knowledge with trivia on composers and famous music. And by connecting your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth, you can use Roland\u2019s Piano Partner 2 app to learn music scores and boost your skills with fun exercises and musical games.\n\nGreat tone makes you want to keep playing, and GO:PIANO with Alexa Built-in inspires with expressive sounds derived from Roland\u2019s premium pianos. Each note responds to your touch like a fine acoustic grand, sparking your creativity and stimulating ongoing musical growth. Electric pianos, organs, and many other sounds are also on board, allowing you to expand your musical experience with a world of different styles.\n\nInterested in learning piano but don\u2019t know where to begin?

      "description": "FULL-SIZE 88-NOTE PIANO. PLAY-ANYWHERE PORTABILITY. SMARTPHONE-POWERED TUITION\n\nWhen you\u2019re learning to play the piano, having 88 keys makes a big difference. Although smaller 61 or 76-note keyboards are portable and easy to handle for younger players, an 88-note full-size keyboard helps you develop the correct technique and become a more expressive player. Most keyboards make you choose between performance and portability, but Roland\u2019s GO:PIANO88 delivers equally on both fronts. Lightweight and road-ready, with optional battery power and headphones, this mobile instrument has a full-size 88-note keyboard and sounds derived from Roland\u2019s best digital pianos, so you can play with the correct technique and expression \u2013 vital for classical music or more complex pieces. GO:PIANO88 also features high-quality onboard Bluetooth speakers that hook up to your smartphone to create a simple and compact learning solution. Once connected, you can start exploring free online content that makes learning faster and more fun \u2013 including online piano lessons, karaoke and tutorial videos for your favorite songs \u2013 or just stream your playlists and jam along. Find a space, grab your smartphone, and start your musical journey with GO:PIANO88.\n\nFind a space, grab your smartphone, and start your musical journey with GO:PIANO88.\n\nGO:PIANO88 has 88 full-size keys for authentic playing feel and expressive touch inspired by the keyboards on acoustic grand pianos. Having the full range of notes lets you play more demanding music, and helps develop the correct techniques for both left and right hands. It also ensures a smooth transition should you play a weighted hammer-action keyboard. And even if you invest in a premium piano, your GO:PIANO88 is the ideal portable instrument for slinging in a gigbag and playing at rehearsals, sessions and shows.\n\nGO:PIANO88 pairs with your smartphone to make learning piano fun. Use Bluetooth to connect wirelessly to your smartphone or tablet, then access songs from your music library or try some free online lessons. You can play along as the music streams through the high-quality onboard speakers or your headphones. Or if you\u2019d prefer some more intensive piano training, try some of the many excellent apps or tutorial videos, before you start working with a personal piano teacher.\n\nNot every home has space for a full-size acoustic piano. But the compact design of GO:PIANO88 lets you play in any setting, with all the benefits of 88 full-size keys. Just sit down, switch on and enjoy GO:PIANO88\u2019s full dynamic range, free from setup hassles or tangled wiring. Plus, to ensure you can practice without disturbing others, GO:PIANO88 lets you plug in headphones to play in peace.\n\nAn acoustic piano ties you to one location, while portable electronic keyboards limit the type of music you can play as they have fewer keys. With GO:PIANO88 and a smartphone, you\u2019re ready to make music whenever inspiration strikes. With its compact 7.5kg design and battery-powered operation, GO:PIANO88 lets you perform through its speakers or practice with headphones. Plus, with wireless connectivity to your smartphone, you can work on your skills any time, any place \u2013 especially as the 88-note full-size keyboard means your technique won\u2019t be compromised.\n\nAs you appreciate GO:PIANO88\u2018s 88-note full-size keyboard, you\u2019ll also be inspired by the choice of onboard sounds derived from Roland\u2019s acclaimed premium pianos. Touch the keys and you\u2019ll hear notes full of character, changing seamlessly in response to your touch, just like on a fine acoustic piano. And alongside the expressive keyboard, GO:PIANO88 lets the dynamics of your playing shine through, encouraging you to improve faster as your skills grow. GO:PIANO88 also includes electric pianos, organs, and other sounds so you can explore different musical styles.\n\nGO:PIANO88 helps you focus on playing, with onboard tools that support your daily practice regime. Try the metronome to build your timing skills or experiment by transposing the keyboard to a different musical pitch. Use the onboard recorder to capture your playing and evaluate your progress. And when you\u2019re ready, connecting your smartphone reveals a world of apps and tutorial videos.\n\nWith the 88-note keyboard and tuition features, you\u2019ll soon be playing better than ever \u2013 and wanting to share your progress with the world. Although recording videos with your smartphone is easy, the built-in mic doesn\u2019t always sound professional. Instead, try plugging your smartphone and GO:PIANO88 into Roland\u2019s GO:MIXER PRO, to directly capture the great sound while you shoot. You can connect additional sources to GO:MIXER PRO as well, including a mic or another keyboard. With the combination of your smartphone, GO:PIANO88 and GO:MIXER PRO, there\u2019s no simpler way to create pro-quality videos for sharing on social media.\n\nInterested in learning piano but don\u2019t know where to begin?

        "Enjoy Traditional Piano Feel with 88 Standard-Size Keys\n\nGO:PIANO88 has 88 full-size keys for authentic playing feel and expressive touch inspired by the keyboards on acoustic grand pianos. Having the full range of notes lets you play more demanding music, and helps develop the correct techniques for both left and right hands. It also ensures a smooth transition should you play a weighted hammer-action keyboard. And even if you invest in a premium piano, your GO:PIANO88 is the ideal portable instrument for slinging in a gigbag and playing at rehearsals, sessions and shows.",
        "Connect Wirelessly To Your Smartphone, Access Online Content and Learn Faster\n\nGO:PIANO88 pairs with your smartphone to make learning piano fun. Use Bluetooth to connect wirelessly to your smartphone or tablet, then access songs from your music library or try some free online lessons. You can play along as the music streams through the high-quality onboard speakers or your headphones. Or if you\u2019d prefer some more intensive piano training, try some of the many excellent apps or tutorial videos, before you start working with a personal piano teacher.",
        "Enjoy Authentic Piano Performance with a Compact, Space-Saving Footprint\n\nNot every home has space for a full-size acoustic piano. But the compact design of GO:PIANO88 lets you play in any setting, with all the benefits of 88 full-size keys. Just sit down, switch on and enjoy GO:PIANO88\u2019s full dynamic range, free from setup hassles or tangled wiring. Plus, to ensure you can practice without disturbing others, GO:PIANO88 lets you plug in headphones to play in peace.",
        "Make Music on the Move with Battery Power and a Wireless Smartphone Connection\n\nAn acoustic piano ties you to one location, while portable electronic keyboards limit the type of music you can play as they have fewer keys. With GO:PIANO88 and a smartphone, you\u2019re ready to make music whenever inspiration strikes. With its compact 7.5kg design and battery-powered operation, GO:PIANO88 lets you perform through its speakers or practice with headphones. Plus, with wireless connectivity to your smartphone, you can work on your skills any time, any place \u2013 especially as the 88-note full-size keyboard means your technique won\u2019t be compromised.",
        "Get Inspired with Roland\u2019s Responsive Piano Sounds\n\nAs you appreciate GO:PIANO88\u2018s 88-note full-size keyboard, you\u2019ll also be inspired by the choice of onboard sounds derived from Roland\u2019s acclaimed premium pianos. Touch the keys and you\u2019ll hear notes full of character, changing seamlessly in response to your touch, just like on a fine acoustic piano. And alongside the expressive keyboard, GO:PIANO88 lets the dynamics of your playing shine through, encouraging you to improve faster as your skills grow. GO:PIANO88 also includes electric pianos, organs, and other sounds so you can explore different musical styles.",
        "Get More from Your Practice Sessions with Onboard Learning Features\n\nGO:PIANO88 helps you focus on playing, with onboard tools that support your daily practice regime. Try the metronome to build your timing skills or experiment by transposing the keyboard to a different musical pitch. Use the onboard recorder to capture your playing and evaluate your progress. And when you\u2019re ready, connecting your smartphone reveals a world of apps and tutorial videos.",
        "Create High-Quality Videos with Your Smartphone and GO:MIXER PRO\n\nWith the 88-note keyboard and tuition features, you\u2019ll soon be playing better than ever \u2013 and wanting to share your progress with the world. Although recording videos with your smartphone is easy, the built-in mic doesn\u2019t always sound professional. Instead, try plugging your smartphone and GO:PIANO88 into Roland\u2019s GO:MIXER PRO, to directly capture the great sound while you shoot. You can connect additional sources to GO:MIXER PRO as well, including a mic or another keyboard. With the combination of your smartphone, GO:PIANO88 and GO:MIXER PRO, there\u2019s no simpler way to create pro-quality videos for sharing on social media."

      "description": "The feature-rich KS-11Z provides a rugged, attractive, and stable platform for 88-note stage pianos and other portable keyboards. Steel construction offers robust performance, while multiple adjustment points allow you to tailor the stand\u2019s width and height for any home, stage, or studio setup. Assembly is fast and easy with integrated push pins and foldable padded support arms.\n\nFor over five decades, Roland has been a worldwide leader in stage pianos, synthesizers, and other keyboards for musicians from hobbyist to professional. The KS-11Z is filled with smart design details informed by our long development knowledge, delivering a premium experience for all types of instruments. Heavy-duty steel construction and a solid Z shape provide rock-solid stability in a minimal footprint, making it a great solution for supporting 88-note pianos in the RD and FP series and other heavy keyboards.\n\nThe KS-11Z is designed for precision adjustment, with a quick-release lever that enables you to set the width to any position within a wide range.\n\nYou can sometimes come across uneven surfaces on performance stages and in studio environments. The KS-11Z features adjustable feet to eliminate wobble and dial in the perfect balance for your situation.\n\nThe KS-11Z features a foldable design for transport and storage. When you\u2019re ready to use the stand, simply unfold the padded arms and they will automatically lock in place. And when the gig\u2019s over, press the buttons to release the pins and fold the arms back down.\n\nSuperior Roland Performance\n\nSeamless Width Adjustment\n\nMaximum Stability\n\nFast and Smooth Assembly",

Whatever you play, wherever your music takes you, you\u2019ll want the RH-5 headphones in your gigbag.\n\nWhen your music-making spans from DAW production to playing a range of electronic instruments, keep the RH-5 headphones at hand and you\u2019ll always be ready to get creative.
