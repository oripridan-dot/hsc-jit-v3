Like the rest of the FP-X series, it features a slim and stylish cabinet that’s easy to transport. But when you invest in this range-topping model, you’re getting an instrument that represents the pinnacle of Roland’s acclaimed piano technology. From the addictively playable PHA-50 hybrid keyboard and Pure Acoustic Piano Modeling from our premium pianos, to custom tone shaping and deep sound immersion from the onboard speaker system, the FP-90X delivers the ultimate FP-X experience.\n\nStandard Features\n \n \n \n \nRoland’s finest acoustic pianos, customizable for your touch.\n\nWhile all FP-X series pianos provide highly authentic tone, the FP-90X goes beyond. With astonishing accuracy, Roland’s Pure Acoustic Piano Modeling sound engine reproduces every aspect of how the rich, resonant sound of an acoustic grand piano is created. Choose from elegant Concert and dynamic Stage pianos via eight ready-to-play variations. Then dive deeper with the onboard Piano Designer, personalizing the sound like a piano technician through a range of easy-to-adjust parameters. And with My Stage and Pure Acoustic Ambience, you can instantly immerse yourself in a variety of realistic environments, from studios to concert halls. The FP-90X’s piano tones are almost infinite—and each is the best in its class.\n\nDive into immersive sound with the powerful four-speaker system.\n\nWith a high-fidelity onboard sound system that projects your music from every angle, no other FP-X series piano can match the sonic depth and wide dynamic range of the FP-90X. A pair of powerful woofers and twin dome tweeters work in harmony with special vents in the cabinet’s back, producing a deep sound field that fully envelops the playing position. In addition to home playing, this full-range system makes the FP-90X a powerful and flexible choice for intimate live performances. And just as important for private practice is the Headphones Acoustic Projection feature, giving you that same thrill of immersion with tone that seems to fill the room—even when nobody else can hear it.\n\nAll the feel of an acoustic grand, without the maintenance.\n\nThe FP-90X’s PHA-50 keyboard—also found in Roland’s top-level home pianos—is an innovative hybrid that gives you the best of both worlds, combining the feel and texture of acoustic piano keys with unbeatable durability. The warm touch of the wood sides will be instantly familiar to seasoned players, while the composite center frame extends from the front of the keys to the back for a stable, assured touch. A crafted hammer action mechanism ensures authentic response, while the look and feel of ivory and ebony are reproduced in minute detail. It’s just like playing a traditional acoustic grand—minus the regular maintenance.\n\nHeavyweight features in a portable format.\n\nThe FP-90X fuses its powerful features into a stylish format that works for modern musicians at home or on the move. With compact dimensions and surprisingly light weight for a hammer-action instrument, it shifts easily around your living space and stores easily in a closet or vehicle. You can supplement your FP-90X by adding a KSC-90 stand and KPD-90 three-pedal unit for a traditional upright experience, or with the portable KS-20X stand and RPU-3 pedal unit for gigging.\n\nEnhance your music making with Bluetooth and USB.\n\nThe FP-90X’s best-in-class piano features are just the start. Via Bluetooth audio, you can stream music from a phone or tablet through the piano’s sound system and jam along. And with Bluetooth MIDI, you’re able to connect with fun music composition apps like Roland’s Zenbeats or Apple’s GarageBand. If you like to sing, connect a microphone, add effects, and amplify your vocals through the speakers, and capture them along with your piano playing using the onboard recorder. The FP-90X even features USB audio/MIDI connectivity, allowing you to interface with computers and record tracks in professional music production software.\n\nFP-X Series Lineup\n\nFind the FP-X piano for you.\n\nFP-60X\n\nNext-step portable piano with enhanced sounds, powerful speakers, and rich ambience effects.\n\nFor serious performance with an eye on budget, the FP-60X is the ideal upper-range choice. While you’ll find the same SuperNATURAL sound engine and 88-key PHA-4 Standard keyboard as models lower down the range, the FP-60X specs up with more onboard sounds, built-in ambience effects, more powerful speakers, and immersive Headphones 3D Ambience.\n\nView Product\nFP-30X\n\nThe super-popular portable piano—upgraded.\n\nRepresenting the sweet spot of the FP-X series, the midrange FP-30X balances its competitive price with performance and features for ambitious musicians. Offering a wider selection of onboard sounds and more powerful internal speakers than the FP-10, it’s an affordable-yet-highly expressive instrument that will support you at every step of your musical journey.\n\nView Product\nFP-10\n\nUnbeatable performance, unbelievable price.\n\nWhen you’re looking for an entry-level portable piano for home practice, small-scale live performance, or music making on the move, the FP-10’s high-quality sound, professional 88-note keyboard, and surprisingly powerful onboard speakers make it the ideal choice.\n\nView Product\nExplore the FP-X Series\n      View In Your Space\nInternational Page\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nInstagram\nSoundCloud\nChange Region\nFlag Icon\nPRODUCTS\nFeatured Products\nPianos\nOrgans\nSynthesizers\nKeyboards\nGuitar & Bass\nDrums & Percussion\nWind Instruments\nProduction\nAmplifiers\nAIRA & DJ\nRoland Cloud\nProfessional A/V\nAccessories\nApps\n\t\nCOMMUNITY\nFacebook\nYouTube\nX (Twitter)\nInstagram\nWorldwide Social Network\n\t\nSUPPORT\nUpdates & Drivers\nOwner’s Manuals\nSupport Documents\nQuick Start Video\nKnowledge Base\nSupport News\nLegacy Product Info\nVulnerability Disclosure Policy\n\t\nARTICLES\nStories\nLearn\nDiscover\n\t\nIR\nManagement Policy\nFinancial Information\nIR Library\nStock Information\n\t\nSUSTAINABILITY\nBasic Sustainability Policy\nHuman Rights Policy\nFor “Environment”\nIn “Society”\nSocial Contribution Activities\nHuman Capital\nImprovement of Customer Satisfaction\nSupply Chain Management\nCorporate Governance\nCompliance Guidelines\nActions for the Compliance\nIntellectual Property and Brand Protection\nExternal Evaluation\n\t\nCOMPANY\nCorporate Information\nPhilosophy\nBrands\nPress Releases\nHistory\nVirtual Patent Marking\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nAccessibility Statement\nWorldwide Social Network\n\tCopyright © 2026 Roland Corporation\nCookie Policy\nBy clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyse site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts, for example, by using cookies for personalized advertising.\nAccept All Cookies\nCookies Settings",
