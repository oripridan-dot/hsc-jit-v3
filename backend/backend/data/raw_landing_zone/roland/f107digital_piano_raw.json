Featuring a streamlined design based on the award-winning F701, it blends perfectly with contemporary furnishings. You get best-in-class tone and touch as well, thanks to the same sound engine and keyboard action found in higher-end Roland pianos. And with onboard Bluetooth®, you can elevate your musical enjoyment with mobile devices and the companion Roland Piano App.\n\nStandard Features\nView the Gallery\nSimply stylish.\n\nRoland home pianos are noted for their attractive designs, and the F107 is no exception. With an understated cabinet similar to our F701—winner of the 2021 Red Dot Design Award—this instrument looks great in any room. The efficient footprint won’t intrude on your space, and the elegant lid hides the keyboard when not in use. When you’re ready to play, the lid becomes a convenient rest for sheet music or a mobile device. And with the smartly organized controls, you can quickly access essential piano functions without distraction.\n\nA SuperNATURAL experience.\n\nThe F107 delivers inspiring sound and expression that you won’t find in other home pianos at this price. Highly acclaimed by educators and professionals musicians, our SuperNATURAL Piano engine combines sophisticated sampling and modeling technologies that put the complex nuances of an acoustic grand piano under your fingers. The tone changes naturally in response to your playing touch and dynamics, providing both a solid foundation for learning and the range to take the music further as skills blossom.\n\nReal acoustic feel.\n\nThe F107’s keyboard and pedals complete the authentic acoustic grand experience, deeply connecting you to the sound engine’s expressive power. The 88-note PHA-4 Standard keyboard provides true weighted response, complete with the subtle click of the escapement action and special Ivory Feel material on the white keys. Sustain, soft, and sostenuto pedals are built into the cabinet, ready to support a variety of advanced pedal techniques as your repertoire grows.\n\nModern connectivity.\n\nMobile devices are an essential part of everyday life, and built-in Bluetooth audio/MIDI connectivity makes it easy to integrate them into your piano world. Stream music and educational content through the F107’s speaker system and play along, or compose your own masterpieces with MIDI music apps like GarageBand and others. USB ports are also available for connecting with computers and flash storage devices.\n\nGo further with the Roland Piano App.\n\nThe Roland Piano App takes the F107 experience to another level. Remotely control piano functions like sound selection, metronome settings, and recording. Or jumpstart your progress with lesson features that include an activity log with goals, flash card games, rhythm exercises, and a One Week Master program that guides you through learning different piano pieces. The app also provides scores for the F107’s onboard song library, plus the ability to add even more via Roland Cloud.\n\n\t Roland Piano App\nAdditional benefits.\n\nAlong with its compact and portable design, the F107 offers numerous advantages over an acoustic piano. Onboard recording lets you check your progress and share music, while Twin Piano mode enables you to play alongside a family member, friend, or teacher. Volume control is just a button press away, and you can connect two sets of headphones to play anytime without disturbing others. And without the need for tuning and regular maintenance, the F107 always sounds perfect every time you to power on.\n\n      View In Your Space\nInternational Page\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nInstagram\nSoundCloud\nChange Region\nFlag Icon\nPRODUCTS\nFeatured Products\nPianos\nOrgans\nSynthesizers\nKeyboards\nGuitar & Bass\nDrums & Percussion\nWind Instruments\nProduction\nAmplifiers\nAIRA & DJ\nRoland Cloud\nProfessional A/V\nAccessories\nApps\n\t\nCOMMUNITY\nFacebook\nYouTube\nX (Twitter)\nInstagram\nWorldwide Social Network\n\t\nSUPPORT\nUpdates & Drivers\nOwner’s Manuals\nSupport Documents\nQuick Start Video\nKnowledge Base\nSupport News\nLegacy Product Info\nVulnerability Disclosure Policy\n\t\nARTICLES\nStories\nLearn\nDiscover\n\t\nIR\nManagement Policy\nFinancial Information\nIR Library\nStock Information\n\t\nSUSTAINABILITY\nBasic Sustainability Policy\nHuman Rights Policy\nFor “Environment”\nIn “Society”\nSocial Contribution Activities\nHuman Capital\nImprovement of Customer Satisfaction\nSupply Chain Management\nCorporate Governance\nCompliance Guidelines\nActions for the Compliance\nIntellectual Property and Brand Protection\nExternal Evaluation\n\t\nCOMPANY\nCorporate Information\nPhilosophy\nBrands\nPress Releases\nHistory\nVirtual Patent Marking\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nAccessibility Statement\nWorldwide Social Network\n\tCopyright © 2026 Roland Corporation\nCookie Policy\nBy clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyse site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts, for example, by using cookies for personalized advertising.\nAccept All Cookies\nCookies Settings",
