This customizable desktop hub is packed with secret weapons to take out the competition, including dual sound mixes, vocal transformer effects, music playback, sound effects, and support for a broadcast-grade mic and headphones. In the heat of the battle, BRIDGE CAST ensures that your audio is always as epic as your gameplay.\n\nThe companion BRIDGE CAST app takes your experience even further, allowing you to customize BRIDGE CAST audio features and enhance streams with royalty-free background music tracks and sound effects via BGM CAST and Roland Cloud.\n\nHighlights\nBRIDGE CAST Overview\n\nLearn how BRIDGE CAST's powerful audio tools will elevate your gaming streams with professional sound quality and easy real-time mixing control.\n\nWatch the Video\nElevate Your Gaming Presence with Legendary Roland Technology\n\nBRIDGE CAST gives you what you need to deliver outstanding sound in every session, coupled with killer sonic tools to help you stand out from the crowd. Roland has been a leading innovator in electronic music and audio/video gear for over 50 years. With BRIDGE CAST on your desktop, you’ll be driving your sound with the brand trusted by generations of top creators worldwide.\n\nFast and Easy Pre-Game Set Up\n1\n\nConnect BRIDGE CAST to your gaming computer via USB-C.\n\n2\n\nPlug in a professional microphone to the XLR input.\n\n3\n\nHook up your headphones.\n\n4\n\nCustomize the audio and panel functions with the companion app.\n\n5\n\nSet up personal and stream mixes with the hands-on controls.\n\nAmp Up Your Sound\n\nBRIDGE CAST lets you chat and interact using a broadcast-grade dynamic or condenser microphone, the foundation of any professional audio setup. The high-performance XLR mic preamp delivers clear, dynamic sound in the box, with no need for messy external add-ons. You get superior audio monitoring too, with a powerful headphone amplifier and high-sensitivity output for pro-quality phones. The versatile headphones connector also supports a headset mic for a quick, single-cable connection.\n\nPersonal Mix + Stream Mix\n\nWith the dual audio mixer in BRIDGE CAST, you can independently balance the mic level, team chats, gameplay sounds, and background music for you and your viewers. Give yourself a winning advantage with a personal mix that prioritizes what you need to hear while gaming. Then create a separate stream mix that’s perfectly balanced for maximum online engagement.\n\nDirect Sound Control\n\nAlong with a headphones output, BRIDGE CAST has a line output for external gaming speakers. Level knobs for each output let you easily control volumes and smoothly transition between phones and speakers during gameplay. There’s also a dedicated streaming level control to dial in the sound for your online audience.\n\nThe Vocal Shapeshifter\n\nMorph your voice and become your character with fun processing derived from Roland’s famous VT voice transformer products. Adjust the pitch and formant to change your age or gender. Or go even further and take on the persona of a beast or alien.\n\nBRIDGE CAST also includes EQ, compression, and other pro vocal processing to level up your streams. A low-cut filter softens pesky “P” and “T” plosives, while the de-esser cleans up harsh “S” tones. There’s a noise suppressor to throttle background distractions, plus reverb to launch your voice into another dimension. And with the muscular hardware DSP handling the audio load, all your computer power is dedicated to gaming and streaming.\n\nVirtual Surround Sound\n\nImmerse yourself in 5.1 or 7.1 virtual surround sound for headphones and stereo speaker systems, powered by advanced Roland technology. Audio is converted from a PC to virtual surround sound via a USB connection, delivering a powerful and engaging sound experience.\n\nThe Audio Cheat Code\n\nSlay your competition by highlighting important game sounds with Game EQ presets. Pinpoint audio frequencies and boost their levels to make it easier to hear critical elements, like enemy footsteps in first-person shooter games. You can even fine-tune while visually monitoring the analyzed waveform in real time. Once you find the ideal settings for different game titles, save them in onboard profiles and call them up with quick button presses while playing.\n\nBrand Yourself\n\nBuilding your brand is an essential part of creating an online following. Choose your core BRIDGE CAST look with bold Black and Ice White finish options. And take it to another level by customizing the detachable faceplate using our downloadable skin template, which allows you to personalize the panel with your team or gamertag design. It’s also possible to customize the LED colors of the four control knobs for additional flair.\n\nCommand and Control\n\nThe ergonomic BRIDGE CAST panel lets you easily control your mix while staying focused on the game. Everything you need is at your fingers, including grab-and-go level knobs and assignable buttons for muting sounds and accessing various functions. The rock-solid design won’t move around on your desktop, and the discrete rear-panel connections keep clutter in check.\n\nCustomize Your Rig with the BRIDGE CAST App\n\nThe powerful BRIDGE CAST app works in tandem with the hardware, giving you full access to an array of in-depth features. Dial in mic and audio parameters, configure Game EQ presets, and more. You can also re-assign hardware controls for your needs and save/recall custom BRIDGE CAST configurations for different games and streaming audiences.\n\nDeep Mic Settings\n\nUsing the BRIDGE CAST app, effortlessly tailor your sound with intuitive microphone settings for speed and precision. The version 5.00 update allows you to adjust EQ with quick-access controls and use the studio-grade compressor to achieve a clean, professional vocal sound with a single fader. There's also an expander that minimizes unwanted background noise without unnatural artifacts.\n\nBGM CAST: Curated Music + Sound Effects\n\nWith BGM CAST, adding background music and sonic color to streams has never been easier. Available through the BRIDGE CAST app and Roland Cloud, BGM CAST puts a growing selection of royalty-free background music and sound effects at your fingertips. Choose music by mood and genre or create playlists of your favorites for stress-free music management. You can also assign sound effects to the four hardware buttons for instant triggering.\n\nA free Roland Account provides 36 background music tracks and 16 sound effects to use at no charge. Signing up for Roland Cloud Core membership through the BRIDGE CAST app unlocks thousands of additional music tracks and hundreds of sound effects, with new selections added each month. Membership also includes powerful tools for modern music creators, including the ZENOLOGY synthesizer, Zenbeats production software, Sound Packs, and more.\n\nGet the BRIDGE CAST App\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Growing Family\n\nIf you need a unified audio and video solution, be sure to check out BRIDGE CAST X.
