This fun portable instrument is filled with Roland’s top technologies, providing a complete creative hub for learning, performing, and writing music.\n\nDevelop and perform authentic piano techniques with the SuperNATURAL Piano engine and 88 weighted-action keys. Explore synthesizers, orchestral voices, and more with the advanced ZEN-Core sound engine, backed by interactive accompaniments that put you in control of a full band. Connect a mic and sing with vocal effects and real-time harmonies. And go further with Bluetooth® audio/MIDI support, onboard recording, computer connectivity, and numerous expansion options on Roland Cloud.\n\nHighlights\nOVERVIEW VIDEO\nExplore the FP-E50\nWatch the Video\nMusical Inspiration Everywhere You Go\n\nWith its all-in-one mobile design, the FP-E50 lets you realize ambitious creative visions anywhere. And thanks to the intuitive interface, it’s easy to stay focused on what’s most important—making music.\n\nAcclaimed FP Style\n\nThe attractive FP-E50 offers all the core features that have made the award-winning FP digital piano series so popular worldwide. It travels easily in and out of the home, while onboard stereo speakers project immersive sound everywhere you play. Connect to external speakers for more sound coverage if needed when performing. Or plug in headphones and keep the music all to yourself.\n\nStreamlined Workflow\n\nWhile the FP-E50 is filled with advanced features, getting around on the instrument is frustration free. The top-level display shows sound, tempo, and other essential information, and the clean panel layout provides direct access to sound selection, favorite tones, keyboard transposition, and more. Many buttons include long-press functions, allowing you to save settings or tweak deeper parameters without menu diving. And with Scenes, you can instantly recall complete setups for the entire keyboard using single actions.\n\nPerform Without Limits\n\nCombining expressive FP piano features with advanced Roland keyboard and vocal technologies, the FP-E50 gives you a powerful range of musical tools to perform any style with passion.\n\nA Premium Piano Experience\n\nWhether you’re new to the piano or an experienced player, the FP-E50 provides a rich foundation for learning, practicing, and performing. Roland’s SuperNATURAL Piano sound engine offers the authentic feel and interactive response of an acoustic grand, enabling you to draw out endless tonal colors with your playing dynamics. The 88 full-size keys complete the experience, with hammer action, escapement, and Ivory Feel material providing the same touch beneath your fingers as a world-class acoustic instrument.\n\nA Universe of Additional Sounds, Powered by ZEN-Core\n\nThe FP-E50 also features the expandable ZEN-Core sound engine, the same advanced sound generator used in professional Roland synthesizers like JUPITER-X and FANTOM. Explore historic Roland synth sounds, brass and orchestral voices, guitars and basses, world sounds, drums, and many others. Using simple controls, you can freely layer piano and ZEN-Core tones or assign different sounds to the left and right hands.\n\nYour Interactive Backing Band\n\nWith its intelligent auto-accompaniment tools, the FP-E50 puts a full band sound at your command. Choose from nearly 200 onboard music styles newly created by professional composers. Drive arrangements with your left-hand fingering, from easy one-note triggering for beginners to full-chord detection for advanced players. Interactive mode makes things even more fun, letting you guide the volume and energy of the backing based on how you play. And with the Chord Sequencer function, you can improvise and develop melodies over colorful preset chord progressions that automatically follow the accompaniment.\n\nFind Your Voice\n\nSing along with keyboard performances using the FP-E50’s mic input and studio-grade vocal effects. Liven up the sound with rich ambience and tighten things up with the compressor and noise suppressor. Perform with impressive real-time harmonies that magically follow the chords you play. Or surprise audiences with voice transformer effects that change your gender or turn you into a funky robot. There’s even a vocoder for creating vintage electronic voices and choir sounds that you guide with notes on the keyboard.\n\nExplore and Create\n\nTake your FP-E50 experience further with Roland Cloud expansion, Bluetooth audio/MIDI support, onboard recording, and USB connectivity with music software on computers and mobile devices.\n\nStay Inspired with Roland Cloud Content\n\nOn Roland Cloud, there’s an ever-expanding selection of FP-E50 content to discover. Grow your accompaniment library with Z-Style Packs, a new range of professionally crafted styles and companion tone setups for popular music styles and regional genres around the world. EXZ Wave Expansions and SDZ Sound Packs are also available, allowing you to expand and customize the ZEN-Core sound engine with genuine Roland sounds and curated content from leading sound designers.\n\nExplore Z-Style Packs\n\n\nWireless Streaming\n\nBuilt-in Bluetooth lets you easily integrate your smartphone or tablet with the FP-E50. Wirelessly stream songs from your music library through the keyboard’s sound system and play along. Follow instructional piano videos on the web. And use Bluetooth MIDI to work with music production apps like Roland Zenbeats and many others.\n\nCapture and Share Your Music\n\nThe FP-E50’s flexible audio recorder allows you to capture a song performance one step at a time, including the auto-accompaniment, left and right hands, and a vocal. After you’re satisfied, save your masterpiece to internal memory for on-demand playback or a USB flash drive for sharing. The FP-E50 also includes a USB audio/MIDI interface to develop your FP-E50 recordings further and compose new pieces in computer music production software.\n\nRoland Piano App\n\nThe Roland Piano App extends the FP-E50 experience with wireless remote operation from your smartphone or tablet. Adjust basic functions with a touch and explore key split, transposition, and other advanced features. Customize sounds with the powerful Piano Designer. Browse songs on Roland Cloud and call up digital scores to learn them at your own pace. Develop your rhythm with the visual metronome. And motivate yourself with an activity log with goals, flash card games, and more.\n\nRoland Piano App support requires FP-E50 Version 1.20 or later (available on the Downloads tab). Some app features are not accessible with the FP-E50.\n\nLearn More\n\n\nAccessories for Home and Stage\n\nRoland offers many stand and pedal options to suit how you use the FP-E50. For piano-focused playing at home, the KSFE50 stand and KPD-70 pedal unit create a unified upright look with integrated sustain, soft, and sostenuto pedals. And when you’re on the move, the stage-ready KS-10X, KS-12, and KS-20X stands and DP series pedals deliver what you need.\n\n      View In Your Space\nInternational Page\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nInstagram\nSoundCloud\nChange Region\nFlag Icon\nPRODUCTS\nFeatured Products\nPianos\nOrgans\nSynthesizers\nKeyboards\nGuitar & Bass\nDrums & Percussion\nWind Instruments\nProduction\nAmplifiers\nAIRA & DJ\nRoland Cloud\nProfessional A/V\nAccessories\nApps\n\t\nCOMMUNITY\nFacebook\nYouTube\nX (Twitter)\nInstagram\nWorldwide Social Network\n\t\nSUPPORT\nUpdates & Drivers\nOwner’s Manuals\nSupport Documents\nQuick Start Video\nKnowledge Base\nSupport News\nLegacy Product Info\nVulnerability Disclosure Policy\n\t\nARTICLES\nStories\nLearn\nDiscover\n\t\nIR\nManagement Policy\nFinancial Information\nIR Library\nStock Information\n\t\nSUSTAINABILITY\nBasic Sustainability Policy\nHuman Rights Policy\nFor “Environment”\nIn “Society”\nSocial Contribution Activities\nHuman Capital\nImprovement of Customer Satisfaction\nSupply Chain Management\nCorporate Governance\nCompliance Guidelines\nActions for the Compliance\nIntellectual Property and Brand Protection\nExternal Evaluation\n\t\nCOMPANY\nCorporate Information\nPhilosophy\nBrands\nPress Releases\nHistory\nVirtual Patent Marking\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nAccessibility Statement\nWorldwide Social Network\n\tCopyright © 2026 Roland Corporation\nCookie Policy\nBy clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyse site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts, for example, by using cookies for personalized advertising.\nAccept All Cookies\nCookies Settings",
