Streamlined and rugged, it features a semi-rigid EVA shell with a tough polyester exterior and a moveable internal partition that creates separate compartments for the sampler and items such as an AC adaptor. There’s also a detachable pouch for small items, plus a shoulder strap with a wide adjustment range. As a bonus, we’ve also included four orange knobs for customizing the look of the SP-404MKII model.\n\nStandard Features\nCustom carrying case for the Roland SP-404 sampler series\nCompatible models: SP-404MKII, SP-404A, SP-404SX, and SP-404\nLight-yet-protective design with semi-rigid EVA shell\nDetachable internal fabric pouch for storing small accessories\nMoveable partition for storage of an AC adaptor and other items\nDetachable shoulder strap\nHeavy-duty zipper and pull with the Roland logo\nIncludes four orange knobs to customize the look of the SP-404MKII (not compatible with other models)\nCreate with Confidence\n\nRoland SP samplers are the bona fide kings of performance-based beatmaking, celebrated for their distinctive sound and ability to create rapid-fire beats anywhere. With the CB-404, you can be sure your SP instrument is well protected no matter where you travel.\n\nLight and Rugged\n\nThe CB-404’s semi-rigid EVA exterior provides durable protection with reduced weight. An internal partition is secured with hook-and-loop attachments, allowing you to adjust the compartment sizes for different SP-404 models and various accessories. A detachable pouch is fitted into the lid for stowing other small items and features a soft fabric material to protect the sampler’s faceplate.\n\nVersatile Strap Design\n\nThe CB-404 includes a tough shoulder strap with a wide adjustment range for different traveling styles. And when you want to carry the case by hand or stow it in a larger bag, simply remove the strap with the easy-to-detach clips.\n\nCustom Knobs\n\nMany creators like to personalize the knobs and faceplate on the SP-404MKII to match their mood or style. The CB-404 comes with a set of four knobs in classic orange, allowing you to change up the look of your sampler in seconds.\n\nNote: The included knob set only works with the SP-404MKII model and is not available separately.\n\nProduct Gallery\nView the Gallery\nInternational Page\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nInstagram\nSoundCloud\nChange Region\nFlag Icon\nPRODUCTS\nFeatured Products\nPianos\nOrgans\nSynthesizers\nKeyboards\nGuitar & Bass\nDrums & Percussion\nWind Instruments\nProduction\nAmplifiers\nAIRA & DJ\nRoland Cloud\nProfessional A/V\nAccessories\nApps\n\t\nCOMMUNITY\nFacebook\nYouTube\nX (Twitter)\nInstagram\nWorldwide Social Network\n\t\nSUPPORT\nUpdates & Drivers\nOwner’s Manuals\nSupport Documents\nQuick Start Video\nKnowledge Base\nSupport News\nLegacy Product Info\nVulnerability Disclosure Policy\n\t\nARTICLES\nStories\nLearn\nDiscover\n\t\nIR\nManagement Policy\nFinancial Information\nIR Library\nStock Information\n\t\nSUSTAINABILITY\nBasic Sustainability Policy\nHuman Rights Policy\nFor “Environment”\nIn “Society”\nSocial Contribution Activities\nHuman Capital\nImprovement of Customer Satisfaction\nSupply Chain Management\nCorporate Governance\nCompliance Guidelines\nActions for the Compliance\nIntellectual Property and Brand Protection\nExternal Evaluation\n\t\nCOMPANY\nCorporate Information\nPhilosophy\nBrands\nPress Releases\nHistory\nVirtual Patent Marking\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nAccessibility Statement\nWorldwide Social Network\n\tCopyright © 2026 Roland Corporation\nCookie Policy\nBy clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyse site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts, for example, by using cookies for personalized advertising.\nAccept All Cookies\nCookies Settings",
