Enter the Roland DP603—a new digital piano whose stylish cabinet and minimalist design are the perfect match for your modern living space. The DP603’s appeal is more than skin-deep, with Roland’s latest SuperNATURAL Piano Modeling for rich, authentic sounds and a PHA-50 keyboard that feels so expressive to play. An onboard selection of practice-friendly features is backed up by wireless connectivity to a tablet or smartphone, allowing audio playback and connectivity with the latest apps. Blending classic sounds with contemporary design, the Roland DP603 is perfect for the modern piano player.\n\n*The Bluetooth feature may not be available, depending on the country where the product is purchased.\n\nHome\nPianos\nUpright Pianos\nDP603\nHome\nDP603\nFeatures\tSpecs\tGuide/Articles\tAccessories\tDownloads\tSupport\n•\t•\t•\t•\t•\t•\t•\n<\n>\nDP603 Digital Piano Performance 1\n\nDP603 Digital Piano Performance 2\n\nSlim, stylish cabinet design to complement modern living spaces\nLatest SuperNATURAL Piano Modeling technology for richer, more detailed grand piano sounds\nAuthentic grand piano touch from the new PHA-50 Progressive Hammer Action Keyboard with Escapement, which combines the look and feel of wood with the durability of modern materials\nHeadphones 3D Ambience technology for natural, realistic sound when practicing privately with headphones\nBluetooth® wireless connectivity to smartphones and tablets for using apps and playing along with audio through the piano’s speaker system\nConnect to a world of exciting apps such as Roland’s Piano Partner 2, which encourages daily piano learning and makes practicing fun\nA choice of three finishes to complement your home: Classic Polished Ebony, Elegant Polished White, or Contemporary Black\nA Stylish Piano to Complement the Modern Home\n\nThe Roland DP603 stands apart from other models on the market. Slim and stylish, the linear cabinet design keeps curves and embellishments to a minimum. An integrated keyboard lid opens to provide an elegant music rest, and closes discreetly with a safety-conscious soft-fall motion. Despite its compact 35 cm (13.5-inch) depth, the DP603 offers the same acclaimed durability that the DP series has been famous for since 2003.\n\nExpress Yourself with SuperNATURAL Piano Modeling and the Responsive PHA-50 Keyboard\n\nStyle meets substance with the Roland DP603, which combines its minimalist look with heavyweight onboard tech that makes it a dream to play. This latest digital piano features the same sound engine as Roland’s flagship LX/HP models, and you’ll hear the benefits of our acclaimed SuperNATURAL Piano Modeling in performance that flawlessly recreates the rich, dynamic response of an acoustic instrument. You’ll also appreciate the new PHA-50 keyboard, whose blend of wood and molded material means it plays like traditional ivory, but without the associated maintenance and expense.\n\nA Dynamic Speaker System Fills Your Home with Music\n\nThe DP603’s onboard speaker system projects warm, enveloping sound, with controllable volume that lets you play loudly or quietly to suit the scenario. This new piano goes even further to double as a wireless speaker system, so you won’t need to clutter your home with an additional hi-fi or stereo. Using Bluetooth wireless technology, simply connect the Roland DP603 with your smartphone or tablet, and then play back your favorite songs through the internal speakers. Or better still, jam along with them!\n\n*The Bluetooth feature may not be available depending on the country where you purchased this product.\n\nLearn Faster with Onboard Educational Tools and Wireless Connection to Piano Apps\n\nLearning the piano can be a solitary experience, but the Roland DP603 supports you every step of the way. With 300 onboard songs ready for you to jam over, you’ll be improving in no time. If you need it, the built-in metronome tightens up your timing before the onboard recorder assesses your development. USB playback/save functions enhance your practice sessions and let you archive performances, while Twin Piano mode enables a learner and teacher to sit side-by-side and play in the same key range. And don’t forget the teaching power of apps—by connecting with your iPad or Android tablet via Bluetooth MIDI or a USB cable, you can access a world of popular apps and online practice videos. A great first step is Roland’s Piano Partner 2, which displays the sheet music of the DP603’s internal songs on your tablet’s screen.\n\nROLAND FEATURED PRODUCTS\nROLAND INTERNATIONAL\nWORLDWIDE SOCIAL NETWORK\nInternational Page\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nInstagram\nSoundCloud\nChange Region\nFlag Icon\nPRODUCTS\nFeatured Products\nPianos\nOrgans\nSynthesizers\nKeyboards\nGuitar & Bass\nDrums & Percussion\nWind Instruments\nProduction\nAmplifiers\nAIRA & DJ\nRoland Cloud\nProfessional A/V\nAccessories\nApps\n\t\nCOMMUNITY\nFacebook\nYouTube\nX (Twitter)\nInstagram\nWorldwide Social Network\n\t\nSUPPORT\nUpdates & Drivers\nOwner’s Manuals\nSupport Documents\nQuick Start Video\nKnowledge Base\nSupport News\nLegacy Product Info\nVulnerability Disclosure Policy\n\t\nARTICLES\nStories\nLearn\nDiscover\n\t\nIR\nManagement Policy\nFinancial Information\nIR Library\nStock Information\n\t\nSUSTAINABILITY\nBasic Sustainability Policy\nHuman Rights Policy\nFor “Environment”\nIn “Society”\nSocial Contribution Activities\nHuman Capital\nImprovement of Customer Satisfaction\nSupply Chain Management\nCorporate Governance\nCompliance Guidelines\nActions for the Compliance\nIntellectual Property and Brand Protection\nExternal Evaluation\n\t\nCOMPANY\nCorporate Information\nPhilosophy\nBrands\nPress Releases\nHistory\nVirtual Patent Marking\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nAccessibility Statement\nWorldwide Social Network\n\tCopyright © 2026 Roland Corporation\nCookie Policy\nBy clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyse site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts, for example, by using cookies for personalized advertising.\nAccept All Cookies\nCookies Settings",
