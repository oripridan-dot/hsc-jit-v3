The midrange model in the FP-X series is a compact and elegant instrument that enhances any living space, backed by an array of features that will satisfy experienced players. At the heart of the FP-60X are Roland’s SuperNATURAL Piano and dynamic 88-key PHA-4 Standard keyboard, along with a selection of expressive acoustic pianos and deep personalization options via Piano Designer. There’s also a wide range of curated sounds for exploring other music styles, plus ambience effects that work with the SuperNATURAL piano models for amazing realism, a powerful stereo sound system, and immersive Headphones 3D Ambience for private playing sessions.\n\nStandard Features\n \n \n \n \nFind your sound with SuperNATURAL and Piano Designer.\n\nThe FP-60X uses Roland’s acclaimed SuperNATURAL Piano to capture every nuance of your playing style, from subtle pianissimo to pounding fortissimo. Going further, you can deeply sculpt and tailor your sound by adjusting low, mid, and high-range tones via the equalizer panel and using the onboard Piano Designer to fine-tune the tone of each individual note. The FP-60X also introduces the My Stage function, which brings together specially selected piano tones and ambience types to provide the immersive experience of playing in venues ranging from intimate practice studios to atmospheric concert halls.\n\nDynamic PHA-4 Standard keyboard that plays like an acoustic grand.\n\nA portable piano should still play beautifully, and the FP-60X does not disappoint. The PHA-4 Standard keyboard puts the hammer action and escapement of a quality acoustic instrument under your fingers, right down to the subtle “click” feel as each key is pressed. A full range of 88 ivory-feel keys let you compose without limits and play the most demanding musical pieces with a flourish, with the expressive SuperNATURAL engine bringing out every last detail.\n\nPerform or practice with powerful speakers and Headphones 3D Ambience.\n\nThe FP-60X is designed to support both solo practice and performance. If you’re gigging at a small venue, you’ll feel the power from the custom-designed stereo speaker system giving you commanding expression across the piano’s entire sound range. And when practicing alone, the Headphones 3D Ambience feature lets you lose yourself in an immersive sound field that feels like the music is coming from the heart of the instrument, not the headphones.\n\nCompact and ready for expansion.\n\nWhile a full-sized piano usually means a dedicated music room, the highly portable FP-60X is easily moved or stored as the mood takes you. This versatile instrument can also be expanded for live performance and traditional playing techniques with available options like the KSC-72 and KS-20X stands and KPD-90 and RPU-3 three-pedal units. And because a piano should look as good as it sounds, the FP-60X features the same modern styling that won several international design awards for its FP-series predecessor.\n\nExpand your music with Bluetooth, USB, and more.\n\nThe FP-60X opens up a world of possibilities with its advanced modern features. With Bluetooth audio and a smartphone, you can play along with music streamed through the piano’s powerful speakers, or work on your technique with online piano lessons. And with Bluetooth MIDI, you’re able to connect with fun music composition apps like Roland’s Zenbeats or Apple’s GarageBand. If you like to sing, connect a microphone, add effects, and amplify your vocals through the speakers, and capture them along with your piano playing using the onboard recorder. The FP-60X even includes USB audio/MIDI connectivity, letting you interface with computers and record tracks in professional music production software.\n\nFP-X Series Lineup\n\nFind the FP-X piano for you.\n\nFP-90X\n\nOur flagship portable piano, with premium features throughout.\n\nInvest in the flagship FP-90X for the best of Roland’s acclaimed piano technology. Featuring an endlessly playable PHA-50 hybrid keyboard, PureAcoustic Piano Modeling that brings your music to life, and a four-speaker system that delivers premium, room-filling sound, you’ll simply never play a better portable piano.\n\nView Product\nFP-30X\n\nThe super-popular portable piano—upgraded.\n\nRepresenting the sweet spot of the FP-X series, the midrange FP-30X balances its competitive price with performance and features for ambitious musicians. Offering a wider selection of onboard sounds and more powerful internal speakers than the FP-10, it’s an affordable-yet-highly expressive instrument that will support you at every step of your musical journey.\n\nView Product\nFP-10\n\nUnbeatable performance, unbelievable price.\n\nWhen you’re looking for an entry-level portable piano for home practice, small-scale live performance, or music making on the move, the FP-10’s high-quality sound, professional 88-note keyboard, and surprisingly powerful onboard speakers make it the ideal choice.\n\nView Product\nExplore the FP-X Series\n      View In Your Space\nInternational Page\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nInstagram\nSoundCloud\nChange Region\nFlag Icon\nPRODUCTS\nFeatured Products\nPianos\nOrgans\nSynthesizers\nKeyboards\nGuitar & Bass\nDrums & Percussion\nWind Instruments\nProduction\nAmplifiers\nAIRA & DJ\nRoland Cloud\nProfessional A/V\nAccessories\nApps\n\t\nCOMMUNITY\nFacebook\nYouTube\nX (Twitter)\nInstagram\nWorldwide Social Network\n\t\nSUPPORT\nUpdates & Drivers\nOwner’s Manuals\nSupport Documents\nQuick Start Video\nKnowledge Base\nSupport News\nLegacy Product Info\nVulnerability Disclosure Policy\n\t\nARTICLES\nStories\nLearn\nDiscover\n\t\nIR\nManagement Policy\nFinancial Information\nIR Library\nStock Information\n\t\nSUSTAINABILITY\nBasic Sustainability Policy\nHuman Rights Policy\nFor “Environment”\nIn “Society”\nSocial Contribution Activities\nHuman Capital\nImprovement of Customer Satisfaction\nSupply Chain Management\nCorporate Governance\nCompliance Guidelines\nActions for the Compliance\nIntellectual Property and Brand Protection\nExternal Evaluation\n\t\nCOMPANY\nCorporate Information\nPhilosophy\nBrands\nPress Releases\nHistory\nVirtual Patent Marking\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nAccessibility Statement\nWorldwide Social Network\n\tCopyright © 2026 Roland Corporation\nCookie Policy\nBy clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyse site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts, for example, by using cookies for personalized advertising.\nAccept All Cookies\nCookies Settings",
