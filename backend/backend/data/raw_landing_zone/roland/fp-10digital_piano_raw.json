This affordable digital piano is always ready to play, with a reassuringly authentic feel from the 88-note PHA-4 Standard keyboard, joined by Roland’s evocative SuperNATURAL Piano tones through onboard speakers or headphones. The portable, space-saving design is perfect for home use, whether practicing techniques in the spare room or performing in the living room. Plus, with Bluetooth® connectivity* and powerful onboard features not offered by any other digital model at this price, the FP-10 is the ideal second piano for more experienced players.\n\n*The Bluetooth feature may not be included depending on the country where the product is purchased.\n\nStandard Features\nView the Gallery\nConnect to the music with the expressive PHA-4 keyboard.\n\nPlaying the piano is all about expression. The FP-10’s PHA-4 Standard keyboard delivers the responsive feel of a fine acoustic piano, with every nuance captured by Roland’s touch-detection technology. High-resolution sensing and escapement support fast key repetition, faithfully translating the subtlest differences in dynamics and tone. The attention to detail continues as you notice a heavier hammer weight in the low registers and a lighter one in the highs. Touch the white keys and you’ll be convinced by a revolutionary moisture-absorbing material that recreates the natural texture and tactile feel of real ivory. And for expressive techniques such as half-pedaling, simply connect the optional DP-10 pedal.\n\nAuthentic sound to engage beginners and inspire professionals.\n\nYou’ll find other instruments in the FP-10’s price band—but none with sound quality in the same league. Roland’s SuperNATURAL Piano sound engine delivers authentic tone that feels expressive and alive, whether you’re a beginner learning core techniques or an experienced player who demands detailed articulation and response. Enjoy rich piano sound that comes flooding into your room via powerful onboard speakers. Or use headphones for immersive private playing around the clock.\n\nSpark your musical creativity with onboard sounds, practice features, and apps.\n\nBursting with modern digital features, the FP-10 makes your playing sessions fun and productive. Get creative in any musical genre with additional sounds like organ, electric piano, and strings. Tighten your timing with the onboard metronome. And learn faster with the Twin Piano Mode that lets student and teacher sit side-by-side and play in duplicate octave ranges. Plus, with Bluetooth and MIDI connectivity, you can connect with a world of music apps ranging from Apple GarageBand to the Roland Piano App.*\n\n*The rhythm function in the Roland Piano App is not available with the FP-10.\n\nThe most compact 88-note digital piano in its class.\n\nIf you’d prefer a full-size piano but don’t have the room in your home, the FP-10 is the answer. As the most compact 88-note digital piano in its class, its streamlined dimensions let you place this instrument anywhere and easily move it as needs change. For even greater flexibility on the go, use the portable KS-13 keyboard stand. Or achieve an integrated upright look and rock-solid setup with the dedicated KSCFP10 stand.\n\nFP-X Series Lineup\n\nFind the FP-X piano for you.\n\nFP-90X\n\nOur flagship portable piano, with premium features throughout.\n\nInvest in the flagship FP-90X for the best of Roland’s acclaimed piano technology. Featuring an endlessly playable PHA-50 hybrid keyboard, PureAcoustic Piano Modeling that brings your music to life, and a four-speaker system that delivers premium, room-filling sound, you’ll simply never play a better portable piano.\n\nView Product\nFP-60X\n\nNext-step portable piano with enhanced sounds, powerful speakers, and rich ambience effects.\n\nFor serious performance with an eye on budget, the FP-60X is the ideal upper-range choice. While you’ll find the same SuperNATURAL Piano sound engine and 88-key PHA-4 Standard keyboard as models lower down the range, the FP-60X specs up with more onboard sounds, built-in ambience effects, more powerful speakers, and immersive Headphones 3D Ambience.\n\nView Product\nFP-30X\n\nThe super-popular portable piano—upgraded.\n\nRepresenting the sweet spot of the FP-X series, the midrange FP-30X balances its competitive price with performance and features for ambitious musicians. Offering a wider selection of onboard sounds and more powerful internal speakers than the FP-10, it’s an affordable-yet-highly expressive instrument that will support you at every step of your musical journey.\n\nView Product\nExplore the FP-X Series\n      View In Your Space\nInternational Page\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nInstagram\nSoundCloud\nChange Region\nFlag Icon\nPRODUCTS\nFeatured Products\nPianos\nOrgans\nSynthesizers\nKeyboards\nGuitar & Bass\nDrums & Percussion\nWind Instruments\nProduction\nAmplifiers\nAIRA & DJ\nRoland Cloud\nProfessional A/V\nAccessories\nApps\n\t\nCOMMUNITY\nFacebook\nYouTube\nX (Twitter)\nInstagram\nWorldwide Social Network\n\t\nSUPPORT\nUpdates & Drivers\nOwner’s Manuals\nSupport Documents\nQuick Start Video\nKnowledge Base\nSupport News\nLegacy Product Info\nVulnerability Disclosure Policy\n\t\nARTICLES\nStories\nLearn\nDiscover\n\t\nIR\nManagement Policy\nFinancial Information\nIR Library\nStock Information\n\t\nSUSTAINABILITY\nBasic Sustainability Policy\nHuman Rights Policy\nFor “Environment”\nIn “Society”\nSocial Contribution Activities\nHuman Capital\nImprovement of Customer Satisfaction\nSupply Chain Management\nCorporate Governance\nCompliance Guidelines\nActions for the Compliance\nIntellectual Property and Brand Protection\nExternal Evaluation\n\t\nCOMPANY\nCorporate Information\nPhilosophy\nBrands\nPress Releases\nHistory\nVirtual Patent Marking\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nAccessibility Statement\nWorldwide Social Network\n\tCopyright © 2026 Roland Corporation\nCookie Policy\nBy clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyse site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts, for example, by using cookies for personalized advertising.\nAccept All Cookies\nCookies Settings",
