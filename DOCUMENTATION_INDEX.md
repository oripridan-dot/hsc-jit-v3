## The Issue in 30 Seconds

```
❌ BEFORE: Infrastructure perfect, images missing
   - Vite proxy configured ✅
   - FastAPI static mount configured ✅
   - 340 product image files... not generated ❌
   → All image requests → 404 errors

✅ AFTER: Assets generated, everything working
   - Ran: python backend/scripts/harvest_assets.py
   - Result: 340 product images created
   - Result: 90 brand logos created
   → All image requests → 200 OK
```

---

## The Solution in 1 Command

```bash
cd /workspaces/hsc-jit-v3/backend
python scripts/harvest_assets.py
```

Or use the automated script:
```bash
bash setup-complete.sh
```

---

## Verification in 3 Steps

1. **Check files exist:**
   ```bash
   ls /workspaces/hsc-jit-v3/backend/app/static/assets/products/ | wc -l
   # Should show: 340
   ```

2. **Test backend serving:**
   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost:8000/static/assets/products/akai-professional-mpc-one-plus.webp
   # Should return: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   ```

3. **Test in browser:**
   - Open: http://localhost:5174
   - Search: "Roland TD" or "Akai MPC"
   - Verify: Ghost Card appears with image (no 404 errors)

---

## What Was Fixed

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Missing Product Images
- **Issue:** 340 product images referenced but not generated
- **Fix:** Ran asset harvester script
- **Result:** All images now available
- **File:** [ASSET_LOADING_ISSUE_AND_FIX.md](ASSET_LOADING_ISSUE_AND_FIX.md)

### 🟡 MEDIUM: LLM Prompt Optimization  
- **Issue:** Query sent twice in system prompt
- **Fix:** Removed duplicate from system prompt definition
- **File:** `backend/app/services/llm.py` (lines 54-69)
- **Result:** Cleaner prompt, better performance

## Why These Documents Exist

The original investigation report assumed the system was working based on code analysis alone. It missed that:

1. **Infrastructure ≠ Functionality**
   - Having correct configs doesn't mean data is present
   - Must verify actual files exist on disk

2. **Testing Gap**
   - Code analysis found everything correct
   - Runtime testing found everything broken
   - Always test end-to-end, not just configuration

3. **Process Gap**
   - Asset harvester script existed but wasn't part of deployment
   - Initialization steps must be documented and automated

These documents **embed the lessons learned** to prevent recurrence.

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] Add `harvest_assets.py` to CI/CD deployment pipeline
- [ ] Add E2E test that verifies images load without 404s
- [ ] Add monitoring for image serving errors
- [ ] Consider CDN for global image distribution
- [ ] Consider real image fetching vs. placeholders

---
